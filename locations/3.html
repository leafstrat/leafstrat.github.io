<p><strong>Brine-Bloom Village</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Oppressed coastal village forced to farm rare &#39;Sea-Bloom Coral&#39; for nobles. Plagued by aggressive Sea Kings.</li>
<li><strong>Faction Control:</strong> WG Affiliated (Nominal). De facto: House Brineworth (Cruel Nobles).</li>
<li><strong>Gangs:</strong> Brineworth Guard (Enforcers), Starved Rats (Desperate Villager Bandits).</li>
<li><strong>Leader Danger:</strong> 1/5 (Gnaw, Starved Rats); 2/5 (Brineworth Guard Captain).</li>
<li><strong>Notable Landmarks:</strong> Overbearing Brineworth Manor on hill, Withered Fishing Docks, Guarded Sea-Bloom Coral Pens, Village Elder&#39;s Humble Shrine.</li>
<li><strong>Log Pose Behavior:</strong> Standard (Sets in 1 day). May flutter near large concentrations of Sea-Bloom Coral.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Hazards:</strong> Aggressive local Sea Kings (Medium-sized), Brineworth Guard patrols, risk of starvation/disease in village.</li>
<li><strong>Key NPCs:</strong><ul>
<li>Old Fisherman Gruff: Knows Sea King patterns and local sea lore.</li>
<li>Elara: Village healer, secretly aids the Starved Rats with supplies/info.</li>
<li>Guard Sergeant Flint: Particularly cruel Brineworth guard, enjoys making examples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Local Legends/Rumors:</strong> The Sea-Bloom Coral placates (or attracts?) a legendary ancient Sea King; a hidden Poneglyph details the island&#39;s true history; House Brineworth stole their initial wealth from pirates.</li>
<li><strong>Minecraft Build Style:</strong> Weathered oak/spruce huts, gravel paths, small farm plots. Contrast with imposing stone/quartz manor using dark prismarine accents (for coral).</li>
<li><strong>Unique Local Resource:</strong> Sea-Bloom Pollen (Crafting: Mildly calming/luminescent ingredient).</li>
<li><strong>Atmosphere/Soundscape:</strong> Sighing wind, mournful cries of hungry villagers, distant Sea King roars, harsh commands from guards, rhythmic <em>thump</em> of coral harvesting tools.</li>
<li><strong>Marine Bounty Poster Presence:</strong> Only official WG tax notices or Brineworth decrees. Pirate posters are forbidden.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Quest Hooks:</strong> Investigate the cause of the Sea Kings&#39; heightened aggression near the coral farms; Smuggle food/medicine to the Starved Rats.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Technology Level:</strong> Basic farming/fishing tools. Guards have standard Marine-issue cutlasses/rifles provided by Brineworth.</li>
<li><strong>Dominant Race:</strong> Primarily Human.</li>
<li><strong>Sea King Activity:</strong> Frequent &amp; Aggressive Sea King Territory, especially near coral pens.</li>
<li><strong>News Coo Reliability:</strong> Arrives daily but often censored or controlled by House Brineworth.</li>
<li><strong>Black Market Specialty:</strong> Minimal; desperate trading of scraps, some hushed dealing in stolen coral fragments.</li>
<li><strong>Alliances/Rivalries:</strong> Oppressive relationship with House Brineworth; Fearful of pirates but might secretly hope for liberation.</li>
<li><strong>Recurring Events:</strong> Weekly &#39;Coral Tithe&#39; Collection Day (High tension); Annual &#39;Bloom Festival&#39; (forced celebration for nobles).</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility Challenges:</strong> Open coast but guarded by patrols; Sea Kings make sea approach dangerous without careful timing/knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More information and quests</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Oppressed coastal village farming &#39;Sea-Bloom Coral&#39;. Plagued by aggressive Sea Kings. Log Pose Standard.</li>
<li><strong>Faction Control:</strong> WG Affiliated (Nominal). De facto: House Brineworth (Cruel Nobles).</li>
<li><strong>Inter-factional Conflicts:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Brineworth Guard vs. Starved Rats:</strong> Constant low-level conflict. Guards patrol, extort, and punish; Rats engage in petty theft, sabotage farming tools, and spread dissent.</li>
<li><strong>Villagers vs. Each Other:</strong> Desperation breeds suspicion. Some villagers secretly report on neighbors to the Guards for meager rewards (scraps of food), creating deep mistrust within the community.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Brineworth Strife:</strong> Rumors that lesser members of the Brineworth family resent the head&#39;s control over the coral trade, potential for internal backstabbing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>NPCs:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Good:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Elara:</strong> Village healer, secretly supports the Starved Rats. Might trade basic potions (healing, regen) or info for protection or resources (wheat, carrots, leather).</li>
<li><strong>&#39;Gnaw&#39;:</strong> Leader of the Starved Rats. Desperate and maybe a bit mad, but hates Brineworth. Could be convinced to cause a diversion for players&#39; benefit if offered food (bread, cooked chicken) or weapons (iron swords).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Neutral:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Old Fisherman Gruff:</strong> Knows the sea but keeps to himself. Might trade fishing knowledge or safe passage routes near the coast for alcohol (potions?) or rare fish catches (pufferfish, tropical fish).</li>
<li><strong>Traveling Merchant:</strong> Occasionally passes through, selling overpriced goods (stone tools, basic blocks). Wary of everyone, just wants to make a profit (emeralds) and leave.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bad:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Guard Sergeant Flint:</strong> Sadistic Brineworth enforcer. Enjoys cruelty, extorts villagers, immediately hostile to obvious pirates. Represents the oppressive force.</li>
<li><strong>Lord Cassian Brineworth:</strong> Head of the House. Arrogant, decadent, views everyone as beneath him. Resides in the manor, heavily guarded. Represents the source of oppression.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Economic Details (Minecraft Trading):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Exports (Players Sell):</strong> Stolen Fish, Foraged Berries/Mushrooms, Basic Tools (if they upgrade villagers), Protection Services (Emeralds).</li>
<li><strong>Imports (Players Buy):</strong> Salt (White Dye/Sand?), Meager Food Supplies (Wheat, Bread - expensive), Information about Guard patrols (cost Emeralds/Food), Directions to hidden paths (cost Food). <em>Sea-Bloom Coral itself is too tightly controlled to buy easily.</em></li>
<li><strong>Local Currency:</strong> Bartering (Food items), some use of Emeralds extorted by guards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Chaotic Neutral Quest Suggestions:</strong><ol>
<li><strong>Guard Distraction:</strong> The Starved Rats plan a minor raid on Brineworth&#39;s food stores. Help them create a bigger diversion (setting fires, freeing livestock) so you can sneak into the manor&#39;s less guarded sections and steal valuables (gold blocks, decorative armor).</li>
<li><strong>Coral &quot;Acquisition&quot;:</strong> Brineworth transports harvested Sea-Bloom Coral (Prismarine Crystals/Blocks stand-in) via carts to a dock. Ambush a cart, defeat the low-level guards, and steal the valuable coral for yourselves to sell elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Exploit the Conflict:</strong> Frame Sergeant Flint for stealing coral, feeding info to Lord Brineworth (or a rival family member) to cause internal chaos you can exploit, perhaps allowing easier access to the manor during the confusion.</li>
</ol>
