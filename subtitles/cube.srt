1
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,206
Hello?

2
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,577
Anyone here?

3
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,225
Hello.

4
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,303
Numbers...

5
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,269
where's the goddamn numbers?

6
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,678
There's something...

7
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,752
Oh, shit.

8
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,097
I mean, they're my numbers...

9
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,867
Damn! Don't I at least
get a shot with my numbers,

10
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,535
you stupid fucks?

11
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,138
I want a chance!

12
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,579
I want a chance like everyone else.

13
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,057
Oh, my God.

14
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,569
Oh, you bastards.

15
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,902
Our Father Which art in heaven,

16
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,481
hallowed be Thy name.

17
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,742
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,

18
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,677
on earth as it is in heaven.

19
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,080
Give us this day our daily bread,

20
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,683
and forgive us our debts
as we forgive our debtors.

21
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,397
Lead us not into temptation...

22
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,624
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

23
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,126
For Thine...

24
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,193
is the kingdom...

25
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,362
and the power...

26
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,238
and the glory, forever and ever.

27
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,537
Amen.

28
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,647
Hello?

29
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,322
Are you all right?

30
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,654
Can you hear me?

31
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,440
Are you hurt?

32
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,847
Don't move. Don't make a sound.

33
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,148
I said, "Don't move."

34
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,055
Are you alone?

35
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,685
Blink once for yes,

36
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:39,786
twice for no.

37
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,295
Is there anyone else in the other room?

38
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,501
All right.

39
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,008
All right. I'm going to release you.

40
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:55,002
But I can take you down again,
as quick as the first time.

41
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,770
So don't scream, understand?

42
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,539
Once for yes, twice for no.

43
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,176
Are you alone?

44
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,750
All right.

45
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,990
What the hell do you think you're doing?

46
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,593
How many rooms have you been in?

47
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,962
What is this place?

48
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,964
I don't know. You tell me,
how many rooms you've been in?

49
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,932
I don't know, five or six. What about you?

50
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,135
Uh... this is my third.

51
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,736
You sure you didn't see anyone else?

52
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:30,737
No.

53
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,005
Have you?

54
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,448
No.

55
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,210
So who are you?

56
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,046
Who are you?

57
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,358
What the fuck are those noises?

58
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:47,554
Relax. This is just for show.
Pretend that you're scared.

59
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:48,922
Should be easy.

60
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,094
All right. Get down here now,
or she's dead.

61
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,463
Some hero.

62
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,065
I have that effect on men.

63
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,996
Glad to see you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

64
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,342
- Is this really necessary?
- Just hang on.

65
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,940
- Isn't that the same...
- Yes.

66
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,244
Hey! Come back!

67
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,981
Wait.

68
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,450
Jesus Christ.

69
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,385
Hey! Wait!

70
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,220
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

71
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,490
This guy sure moves quickly.
He's just gone.

72
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,935
Maybe something made him go,
maybe you should come back.

73
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,345
This place is awful.

74
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,078
Please don't hurt me.

75
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,252
Don't be frightened.

76
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,585
Don't worry.

77
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,029
There's nobody else here. Just me.

78
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,391
I'm Kate.

79
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,560
What's your name?

80
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,698
Sasha.

81
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,367
That's a beautiful name.

82
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,403
Don't worry.

83
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,744
Everything's going to be all right, okay?

84
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,887
Do you understand me?

85
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,748
I'm just blind, not retarded.

86
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,233
Finally.

87
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,569
I was beginning to wonder
if I was the only one in here.

88
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,171
I kept hoping I would
find some other people.

89
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,575
I've been wondering around
these rooms for hours.

90
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,276
Stay away from me!

91
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,344
No one's going to hurt you.

92
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,378
Well, certainly not.

93
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,648
No. No. I come in peace, young lady.

94
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,083
I'm Jerry.

95
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,452
This is Sasha. She's blind.

96
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,020
And she's very scared.

97
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,958
What a bummer, to be blind in this place.

98
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,160
Do you know what this place is?

99
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,962
No. No. No.

100
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:46,199
I don't suppose, either of you two could
let me know what we're doing in here?

101
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,369
No.

102
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,972
Oh... Jerry Whitehall.

103
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,052
Kate Filmore.

104
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,380
What are you doing?

105
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,048
I'm marking the rooms.

106
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,217
This is the fourth room you've been in?

107
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,218
Yeah.

108
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,654
I thought you said you've been
wandering these rooms for hours.

109
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,223
Yeah. That's the weird thing isn't it?

110
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:14,160
Each one of these rooms, has six
of these doors, or portals.

111
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,030
But no matter how many portals
I go through,

112
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,999
I always wound up in the same three rooms.

113
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,734
Until now.

114
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,637
It's as if the rooms
were moving around or something.

115
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:26,740
Yeah. But I don't feel any motion, do you?

116
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,741
No.

117
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,376
It's just so strange.

118
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,729
I ran into this guy...

119
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,649
Oh, no. It's getting closer!

120
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,051
- What is?
- I don't know.

121
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,520
Something's coming after us,
and I don't think it likes us.

122
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,789
I don't hear any people.
I think it's just motors.

123
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,926
He wants us dead. We have
to get out of here right now.

124
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,127
Any suggestion on which way to go next?

125
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,995
Your guess is as good as mine.
I don't know.

126
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,064
Please, we have to move!

127
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,299
Uh... here.

128
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,735
Okay. Sasha, we're going to have
to climb a bit of a ladder.

129
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,970
Hold on to me.

130
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,310
- Move quickly.
- Get me out of here!

131
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,974
Help!

132
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,310
- Help me!
- Oh, God!

133
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,856
There's a guy hanging.

134
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,815
I can't hold him much longer!

135
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,050
- Okay. I'm coming.
- Oh, my God.

136
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,584
What's happening?

137
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,163
Hurry!

138
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,122
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

139
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,424
Grab his...

140
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,558
I'm coming. I'm coming.

141
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,331
Here...

142
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:22,896
Good girl. Good girl.

143
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,065
Sasha, you're going to be okay.

144
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,534
Just stay here. You're going to be okay.

145
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,839
There you are.
You've found some friends, huh?

146
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:33,840
Help me get him down.

147
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,920
Fantastic.

148
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,680
- Give me some space.
- I'm here.

149
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,082
- I can grab his legs.
- I'm loosening the belt.

150
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:46,353
- All right. All right. I got him.
- I'm losing it.

151
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:47,153
Ready, you got it?

152
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,722
- Yeah.
- Hurry.

153
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:49,994
There it goes.

154
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,772
I know you want a cigarette, but not yet.

155
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,332
- Slowly. Easy.
- I've got his legs.

156
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,201
Lean him up against this wall.

157
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,103
Okay. Watch his head.

158
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,471
That's it.

159
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,380
Just make sure he's upright.

160
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,381
He's alive.

161
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:11,911
He's breathing.

162
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,346
Good.

163
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,347
He's military.

164
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,649
Colonel Thomas H. Maguire,
Department of Defense,

165
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,618
Jesus Christ.

166
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,087
He's Pentagon, hi-tech liaison.

167
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,422
You...

168
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,001
how the hell would you know?

169
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,227
A buddy of mine's doing 10-20 upstate

170
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,829
for cracking the mainframe
on the Pentagon two years ago.

171
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,766
I helped him write the code.
Maybe that's why I'm in here.

172
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,968
You know for sure we're in prison?

173
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,804
- I'm assuming...
- You know what they say.

174
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,076
Thanks. That's helpful.

175
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,278
Jerry Whitehall. Thanks.

176
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,880
Simon Grady.

177
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,481
That's Kate.

178
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,582
Sasha.

179
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,753
I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.

180
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,687
Max Reisler.

181
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,266
- Thanks.
- Sasha...

182
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,162
Sasha...

183
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,163
Jerry, could you...

184
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,231
Sure, of course.

185
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,667
Come on, sit him up.

186
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,537
Let's get you sitting up straight here.

187
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,584
Sasha, you okay?

188
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,776
This man's been beaten badly.

189
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,978
He's been tortured.

190
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,921
Look at his hand.

191
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,117
- Cigarette burns.
- Jesus.

192
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,653
They're coming for us next.

193
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,355
Don't you worry.
I won't let anyone hurt you.

194
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,492
I hope it's that easy, Kate.

195
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,863
There's nothing in here.

196
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,976
What do you think?

197
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,737
I figure he knows something
he didn't want anyone to know.

198
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,407
That's usually why people are tortured.

199
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,876
How do you know, Mr. Cigarette Burns?

200
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,614
What are you, an expert?

201
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,350
As a matter of fact,
you weedy little shit...

202
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,060
They're coming! They're coming!

203
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,833
They're coming. They're coming.

204
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,865
Oh, hello.

205
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,134
Do you know where the showers are?

206
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,436
I seem to be lost, again.

207
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,072
I always get lost in this gym.

208
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,208
I don't know why my daughter-in-law
insists on bringing me here.

209
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,511
- It's all the way across town.
- Whoa.

210
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:25,945
Watch your step. Watch your step.

211
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,581
Thank you, dear.

212
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,558
Oh, my goodness.

213
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,020
I'm afraid I can't help you
with the showers.

214
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,488
I'm Jerry.

215
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,725
You're not little Jerry Reisback, are you?

216
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,193
No.

217
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,934
Thank goodness. He's my paperboy,
and I owe him $10.

218
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,769
Right. Well, this is Simon.

219
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,238
Kate and Sasha.

220
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:53,239
Hello.

221
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,108
And uh...

222
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,944
Max.

223
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,312
- Max.
- And you are?

224
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,880
I'm Mrs. Paley.

225
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,315
How do you do Mrs. Paley?

226
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,552
You don't happen to know
why you're here, do you?

227
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:09,188
Oh, dear. I was never
very good at philosophy.

228
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,869
Do any of us know what's going on here?

229
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,208
Sorry.

230
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:23,640
I've been trying to get a handle
on the configuration of these rooms.

231
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:25,738
All I can say is...

232
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,373
They just don't make any sense.

233
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,409
That's right. They sure don't.

234
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,579
It's as if the rooms
are moving around very quickly.

235
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,614
There's got to be
some kind of logic to it.

236
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,216
These rooms just seem to repeat.

237
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,553
You go in one direction,
the room just loops back on itself.

238
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,690
It's getting closer.

239
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,659
Sasha, do you know what it is?

240
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,628
Not really.

241
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,463
But I can hear it.

242
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,966
All the time, even when you don't.

243
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,168
And it sounds...

244
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:58,181
it feels wrong.

245
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,185
Maybe we're in hell.

246
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,954
All right,

247
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,453
let's get some real answers.

248
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,883
His answer was suicide.

249
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,419
Not exactly a comforting thought.

250
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,788
Soldier, up on your feet.

251
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,624
Careful, he's hurt.

252
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,325
Come on, pumpkin, up you come.

253
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,294
Stop it. He's in serious condition.

254
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,395
Stop it.

255
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,931
- Listen to me, sweetheart...
- I'm not your sweetheart, asshole.

256
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,733
All right. This man's been tortured.

257
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,101
You want to be next when they come for us?

258
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,168
Who exactly are they?

259
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,770
Well, I'm going to find out. Come on.

260
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,140
Stop it. Stop it.
Are you trying to kill us?

261
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,842
It's not going to help us
if he dies, you know?

262
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,444
You've got no information whatsoever.

263
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,652
- It's here.
- Jesus...

264
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,053
what the fuck?

265
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,055
Come on.

266
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,257
- He's conscious.
- Sit him up. Sit him up.

267
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,459
Come on, soldier. Talk to me, soldier.

268
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,361
Talk to me. What's going on here?

269
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,063
Are you speaking to me?

270
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,464
Yes. Jesus Christ. Yes.

271
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,199
Just tell me, how do we get out of here?

272
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,901
I don't know.

273
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,536
You figure out the code,

274
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,405
you get out.

275
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,573
The first one had rules...

276
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,275
The first one? What are you talking about?

277
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,910
Leave him alone. He's delirious.

278
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,514
He knows something, all right?
I'll carry him myself, just...

279
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:16,783
The first one had numbers...

280
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,718
What do you mean, "the first one"?

281
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,454
- Let him go.
- I'm out of here.

282
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,462
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

283
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,730
Did you hit your head?

284
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,065
Yeah. I slipped.

285
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,434
It's a wall. It wiggled.

286
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:37,037
- You sure you're okay...
- Look. There it goes again.

287
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,974
That... that... that...

288
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,410
That's... that's... I don't know.

289
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,454
No!

290
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,151
Holy fuck.

291
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,153
What is that?

292
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,788
I don't know.

293
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,623
But I don't think we should
stick around to find out.

294
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,625
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

295
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,627
Come on, Sasha, I'm here.

296
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,629
I'm right behind you, honey.

297
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:04,764
Hurry, let's go!

298
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,138
Easy, easy...

299
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,537
For Christ's sake.

300
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:12,809
What the...

301
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:19,512
Come on. There you go.

302
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,782
- Grab right there.
- Where are you?

303
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,117
Come on, Colonel.

304
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,085
It's time for us to go.
I'm not done with you yet.

305
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:28,221
I'm not going.

306
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:29,389
What did you do that for?

307
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,957
I'm not going anywhere soon.

308
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:31,958
Well, fuck you.

309
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:33,025
Come on, Kate.

310
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,260
Let's get out of here.

311
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,695
Come on, where's the key?
Do you have the key?

312
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,296
- You mean this?
- Yeah.

313
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,265
No.

314
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,366
What did you do that for?

315
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:44,137
You don't honestly think you can escape?

316
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:45,181
We have to try.

317
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,018
Oh, my God.

318
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,016
This is gonna hurt.

319
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,022
Kate, get the hell up here!

320
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:05,324
No. I'm not leaving without him.

321
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,993
For God's sake, he's a dead man. Move.

322
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,428
God.

323
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,329
There's no time left. Let's go.

324
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,202
Oh, my God. There's got to be a way.

325
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,407
Get the... get the hell out of there.

326
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,909
- Oh, my God.
- Leave him, he's dead.

327
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,295
Oh, my God.

328
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,980
Let me go.

329
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,688
Let me go.

330
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:49,970
It's still coming. Come on.

331
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,125
So what the hell happened back there?

332
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,226
I don't know.

333
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:13,986
Hello.

334
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,988
And where did you come from?

335
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,590
What's your name?

336
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:23,062
I'm... I'm Kate.

337
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,131
Don't you remember me?

338
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:26,904
I'm Mrs. Paley.

339
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,116
The Colonel was our only link
to this place.

340
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,422
Maybe not.

341
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:44,183
I designed the door panels in here.

342
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:46,024
The touch sensors.

343
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:48,454
What?

344
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:51,330
I was freelancing
for a subcontractor, I...

345
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,995
You didn't think this
was worth mentioning before?

346
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,496
I signed a confidentiality...

347
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,366
Given our current situation,
I'd say it's null and void.

348
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:01,701
- Jesus Christ!
- The legal...

349
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:04,103
- What the hell is this place?
- I don't know.

350
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,772
You don't think the guy that makes
the toilets in the space shuttle,

351
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,507
gets to see the plans for the rest of it?

352
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,610
You must have had some
idea what they were building.

353
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,612
It was experimental. It was a prototype.

354
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:13,613
For what?

355
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:14,981
- I'm not sure.
- For what?

356
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,282
Leading-edge stuff.

357
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,150
There were rumors...

358
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,518
What kind of rumors, Jerry?

359
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,961
What rumors?

360
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:24,995
Quantum teleportation.

361
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,159
Pardon?

362
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,499
They were just rumors.

363
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,533
You mean, like... "Beam me up, Scotty"?

364
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,569
Okay.

365
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,904
Now this is getting ridiculous.

366
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,139
What do you know, Jerry?

367
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,140
Nothing.

368
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,808
- You're lying.
- Why would I lie?

369
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,577
Because both you and the Colonel
work for them.

370
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,579
Them? Who the hell are "them" anyway?

371
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,114
What? The government? The mafia?

372
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,420
Aliens?

373
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,696
Oh, my goodness.

374
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,255
It's a tesseract.

375
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,224
Christ, she's losing it.

376
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:00,065
Isn't it beautiful?

377
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,167
Isn't what beautiful, Mrs. Paley?

378
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,010
Holy shit.

379
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,137
If you look at it
from just the right angle...

380
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,440
What did you call it again, Mrs. Paley?

381
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,475
It's a tesseract, sweetheart.

382
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,781
Tesseract?

383
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,547
Tesseract.

384
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,549
It's... It's a tesseract.

385
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,584
How do you know it's a tesser... act,

386
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:26,886
or whatever you call it?

387
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,155
Is the second act beginning already?

388
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,257
We should be getting back to our seats.

389
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:32,391
Excuse me.

390
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:33,659
Yeah.

391
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,327
Is she for real?

392
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,698
A tesseract, Holy Christ, of course.

393
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:40,616
A tesseract.

394
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,069
Jerry, you okay?

395
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,504
Yeah, yeah. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

396
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,307
It's been staring at us
in the face the whole time.

397
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,077
Maybe you could share
with the rest of the class.

398
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:52,745
Oh. Of course.

399
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,013
A tesseract...

400
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,748
it's another name for...

401
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:57,650
a hypercube.

402
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,851
A what?

403
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,487
A hypercube... a four-dimensional cube.

404
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:02,488
Four dimensions?

405
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,423
All the elements are there.

406
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:07,493
Rooms repeating.
Rooms folding in on themselves.

407
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:08,761
Teleportation.

408
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,932
It could all very well add up.

409
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,735
Look. Here. See?

410
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:19,004
Let's call one dimension, length,

411
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,041
and represent that with a simple line.

412
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,179
Now, two dimensions are length and width,

413
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,247
which can be represented
by a single square.

414
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,982
Now if we extend that square,

415
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,891
one more dimension...

416
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,588
we get... a cube,

417
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,022
which has three dimensions.

418
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,759
Length, width, and depth.

419
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,393
Come on, we've all passed
the eighth grade.

420
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,428
Hush.

421
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:46,065
Here's the really funky part.

422
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,500
If you take this cube,

423
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,869
and extend it one more dimension,

424
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:51,676
we get...

425
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:53,773
A tesseract.

426
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:56,642
I thought time was considered
to be the fourth dimension.

427
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,310
Sure. That's one idea.

428
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,347
But what if you have
a fourth spatial dimension?

429
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:03,682
- There's no such thing.
- Why don't you shut up?

430
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:04,683
Okay. Okay.

431
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,052
Let's just say that
we are in this hyper...

432
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,788
- Cube.
- Cube. Whatever.

433
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:10,799
Does this diagram show us how to get out?

434
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,261
Well, uh... no.

435
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,730
A hypercube isn't supposed to be real.

436
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,199
It's just a theoretical construct.

437
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,836
Oh. Well that makes me feel better.

438
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:26,405
Is there a theory on how
we might get out of this...

439
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,041
theoretical construct?

440
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:30,509
I don't know.

441
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,845
Don't worry, dear.

442
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:35,255
It's just a matter of time.

443
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,623
That's so much clearer. Thank you.

444
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:40,653
Great.

445
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:42,555
Anyway...

446
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:44,657
here's my theory for what it's worth:

447
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,194
We are all...

448
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:51,664
unwilling participants... in a game show,

449
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:54,768
and are being videotaped as we speak.

450
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,738
Although I don't condone forcible
abduction of innocent people,

451
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,741
we can take comfort in the fact
that once the show airs,

452
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:06,078
we'll be able to parlay this
into lucrative sponsorship deals.

453
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:08,080
Okay, Max.

454
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,549
And what's the object of this game show?

455
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,993
Hmm... I don't know. To get out alive?

456
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,125
I think we should make a map.

457
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,360
I don't think a map
is really going to help us.

458
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,133
Look at that.

459
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,902
That wasn't there a minute ago.

460
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:31,103
Did you write that?

461
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,873
No. I left my wings at home.

462
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:36,876
I just marked this room as 10 before it.

463
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:39,078
Somebody's been here before us.

464
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:41,146
Thanks. A really large someone.

465
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,716
Why go through the trouble
of writing it on the ceiling?

466
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:47,186
60,659 rooms?

467
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,420
Christ.

468
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,122
This place must be huge.

469
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,757
Oh, yes, yes.

470
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:55,160
In a hypercube, there could be
60 million rooms.

471
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,329
She could be right.

472
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,568
There's a comforting thought.

473
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:04,446
What the hell are you doing?

474
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,139
Yowza.

475
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,675
The ratings on this show just doubled.

476
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:11,043
What do you see?

477
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,578
A girl.

478
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:13,946
Oh, Jesus.

479
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,616
I'm going in.

480
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,618
- I think I'm going to puke.
- You all right?

481
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,186
Okay. I just... whoa...

482
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,421
Hey. Hey. Hey.

483
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,723
- Get back here.
- What's happening?

484
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,026
- What's going on?
- Help!

485
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,560
Try to give me your hand.

486
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,663
- Help me!
- You okay?

487
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:32,106
What the hell is going on in there?

488
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,334
Max, don't be an idiot.

489
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,603
- Come on back.
- No, it's okay.

490
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,738
- The gravity shifted.
- She needs help,

491
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,942
- she may be hurt.
- Wow.

492
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,722
Are we going in there or what?

493
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:58,590
Maybe she knows something.

494
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,426
What about our...

495
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,506
less agile members?

496
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:05,571
I have an idea.

497
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,813
Hello.

498
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:14,173
Whoa.

499
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:15,975
I'm all right.

500
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:17,452
Miss?

501
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,383
Hey, Miss.

502
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,552
Hey.

503
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,587
Wake up.

504
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:29,888
She's on her way.

505
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,332
I guess it's time for plan B.

506
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,535
Give her mouth-to-mouth
and see if it works.

507
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,137
Think I should?

508
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:47,309
Oh, very funny.

509
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,211
Hi.

510
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:53,879
What's wrong?

511
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,547
What the hell?

512
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,082
Where am I?

513
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,219
That's the million dollar question.

514
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,959
Does she have to keep cackling like that?

515
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,694
Come on, let's get this over with.

516
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,536
All right. This is going
to be some kind of...

517
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,936
Yeah, Mrs. Paley.
Just keep laughing there.

518
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:21,673
This is more fun than I've had since

519
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,109
my thirteenth birthday.

520
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:26,812
Glad somebody is having fun.

521
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:28,914
This reminds me of that rope swing

522
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:30,816
we used to have at home.

523
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,452
For God's sake, Mrs. Paley,
this isn't a game!

524
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,254
Come on. Come on down.

525
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:36,789
Simon, you guys, keep her steady.

526
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:38,368
All right, all right. Come on.

527
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:42,028
Okay. And you're down. That's good.

528
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,329
It's okay. She's down.

529
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:45,664
- We've landed.
- Yeah.

530
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:48,267
It's your turn, you'll have
to climb around the sides.

531
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:51,036
Well, this is a lot
like the other ones, isn't it?

532
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,572
Christ. This is going to be fun.

533
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:56,108
Hello there. I'm Mrs. Paley.

534
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,552
Who the hell are you people?

535
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,779
Well...

536
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,792
I'm Kate, and this is Mrs. Paley.

537
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:06,624
And I am Julia.

538
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,555
And this is...

539
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,397
Hey. Is this your jacket?

540
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:14,860
No.

541
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,361
Well then how did I...

542
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,704
I must have had more
to drink last night than I thought.

543
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,609
There's nothing in here.

544
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,707
How the hell did I get here?

545
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,480
Have we been kidnapped?

546
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,886
That's a really good question.

547
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:51,269
Does anyone remember how we got here?

548
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:55,400
Last thing I remember was going to sleep.

549
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,735
Where?

550
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,637
In my bed.

551
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,739
Where do you live?

552
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,408
Lincoln, Nebraska.

553
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:07,246
Kate, I am a healthy, married,
male white engineer,

554
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:10,315
who enjoys reading horror novels
and eating chocolate ice cream,

555
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,396
as well as climbing around
psycho-jungle-gyms.

556
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:17,857
Okay.

557
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,928
I remember driving home
from Maine State Hospital.

558
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:25,898
It was late,
and I just wanted to get home,

559
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:29,001
I've been working long hours.
I'm a psychotherapist.

560
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:30,705
Simon.

561
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:33,372
New Haven.

562
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:35,340
I was out for a drink.

563
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,942
What do you do?

564
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,914
A consultant.

565
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:44,016
Management consultant.

566
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:45,784
Yeah, right.

567
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,953
And I'm Santa Claus.

568
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:51,193
Okay, Max. How about you?

569
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:56,834
I live in Palo Alto.
I design computer games.

570
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:00,968
The last thing I remember,
I fell asleep on my keyboard.

571
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:04,636
Sasha.

572
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,171
And where do you live?

573
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,308
New Mexico.

574
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,579
I was doing my homework
in the kitchen, like I always do.

575
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,182
Nothing ever happens to me.

576
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,256
The last thing I remember...

577
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:24,595
is taking the dog for a walk.

578
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:28,660
Julia?

579
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,030
I was at an after party
for a premiere in Santa Monica.

580
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,966
Are you an actress?

581
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:36,101
No.

582
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,537
No, I'm an attorney.

583
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:42,380
Let's just say if I was kidnapped
it was for the ransom.

584
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,912
So we've got Silicon Valley,
Connecticut, Nebraska,

585
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,548
Hollywood, Maine.

586
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,584
Mrs. Paley, where exactly do you live?

587
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:56,355
In that high-rise at the corner
of Riverside and 94th.

588
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:58,557
Could you give me a lift home, dear?

589
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,493
I seem to have lost my daughter-in-law.

590
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,061
Ignorance is bliss.

591
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,163
This doesn't make any sense.

592
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,499
Yeah, well...

593
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,668
I think they probably flew us here.

594
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:13,438
Drugged us and flew us out here
in private or military jets.

595
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,274
That's what I think.

596
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:17,542
- Where is here?
- I don't know.

597
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,945
Your guess is as good as mine.

598
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:23,515
They could have built
an hypercube structure anywhere.

599
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,551
And if this thing really does fold space,

600
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,787
we could be literately anywhere.

601
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:29,855
What the hell...

602
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:31,523
What?

603
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,792
Here is that number again.

604
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,661
6-0-6-5-9

605
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:38,397
This can't be the same room. Jesus!

606
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:41,833
It's not, because now they're
in a string of other numbers.

607
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,277
There just can't be that many rooms.

608
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,839
Maybe they are not room numbers.

609
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,818
Maybe somebody else figured something out.

610
00:36:56,681 --> 00:37:00,185
We are definitely not alone.

611
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,593
Check this out.

612
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,189
What is it?

613
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:05,223
What's happening?

614
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,734
Julia, is that your watch?

615
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,095
No.

616
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:12,097
No, it's mine.

617
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,433
It...

618
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:16,368
Well, this is bizarre.

619
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:19,071
What, somebody else uses
a watch just like yours?

620
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:21,506
Somebody is playing games with us.

621
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,176
Shit... look...

622
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:28,347
this is the watch that my wife
gave me on my 40th.

623
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:29,517
See?

624
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,396
This is the watch we've just found.

625
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,293
Maybe it's your game
that we are playing, Jerry.

626
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:43,929
You designed the doors,
your watch. What's next?

627
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,031
- No, I...
- For the love of God, Mrs. Paley...

628
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,532
Mrs. Paley, please don't.

629
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,135
Oh, my goodness, I think he's still alive.

630
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,337
- Mrs. Paley, please.
- Get her down.

631
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:53,638
Easy, careful.

632
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,607
Is somebody in there?

633
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,008
- What do you see?
- Jerry?

634
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,644
Oh, God. There's a guy down here.

635
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:00,712
Oh!

636
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:03,048
- The gravity's shifting.
- What's happening?

637
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:04,416
You okay? Are you all right?

638
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,151
Simon, what's going on?

639
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:07,285
My God.

640
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,888
Hey, hey, fellow.

641
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,490
Oh, Jesus.

642
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,091
- Be careful.
- Ugh!

643
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:16,194
- Is he alive?
- I don't think so.

644
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,296
- Let's roll him over.
- Yeah, yeah...

645
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:22,474
Oh, God, is he ripe.

646
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,937
What... what is that?

647
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:29,040
Oh! It looks pretty dead to me.

648
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,342
I hope he's still alive.

649
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:32,577
He's been here for a while, Mrs. Paley.

650
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,880
Oh, poor man.

651
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,615
Who do you think wrote these numbers?

652
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:39,885
He must have written them himself,
It's all upside down.

653
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,554
It's the same writing
as those numbers we keep seeing.

654
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,523
Oh, no!

655
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:47,159
It's poor Dr. Rosenzweig.

656
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:49,127
You know him?

657
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:52,931
He'll never get his Nobel Prize now.

658
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:56,034
- Who the hell is he?
- Holy Christ...

659
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,336
Phil Rosenzweig.

660
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,540
Last year he was the leading
theoretical physicist in his field.

661
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,543
- Which was?
- Quantum chaos.

662
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:08,279
Oh, God, Phil Rosenzweig.
I read his book...

663
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:17,789
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

664
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,459
Is he...?

665
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:24,363
Kate, is he...?

666
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,906
- Yeah, he's gone.
- You are positive?

667
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,541
Uh-huh.

668
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,376
Somebody...?

669
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,312
I'm here, Sasha. Got you.

670
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:42,314
Does anyone understand these numbers?

671
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:43,615
What was he writing?

672
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:44,983
Beats me.

673
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,428
May be he was trying to calculate
his way out of here.

674
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,890
Looks like he ran out of time.

675
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,693
How did old Mrs. Paley know him?

676
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:57,762
- I don't know.
- Hey, look. More numbers.

677
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,664
Same handwriting.

678
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,601
The question is,
did he solve it before he died?

679
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:06,372
God. She's okay. Are you okay?

680
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:08,073
He must have finished it here.

681
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:10,375
Look, there it is again... 6-0-6-5-9.

682
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,410
How does that get us out of here?

683
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,946
- It's got to mean something.
- Yeah, but what?

684
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,682
I don't know, but we better remember it.

685
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:22,087
You know, I wonder if is he's got a...

686
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:25,600
What are you doing? That's disgusting.

687
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:29,761
Found a pen.

688
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,197
Hope you have better luck than he did.

689
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,332
Oh, no, this can't be happening.

690
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,700
Oh, dear.

691
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,169
Oh, dear, just wait.

692
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,139
Oh, I'm such an idiot.
Oh, no. Wait a minute.

693
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,208
She's gonna drive me insane.

694
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:46,511
Oh, it was right here.

695
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,080
- What is it, Mrs. Paley?
- Izon, where are you?

696
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,483
I'm such an idiot.

697
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:55,287
- Did she say Izon?
- Izon, where are you?

698
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:57,188
You come back here this instant.

699
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,591
Who are you looking for Mrs. Paley?

700
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:02,060
Have you seen my dog?

701
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,397
He's a darling little Shi-Tzu. Darn it.

702
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:12,003
Her dog's name is "Izon"? That's weird.

703
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,505
I thought Izon was a...

704
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:15,173
A weapons manufacturer.

705
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:16,842
Yes.

706
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:24,083
And you guys would know that because...

707
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,459
I read the papers.

708
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:33,825
- Mrs. Paley...
- Poor puppy...

709
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:37,362
Mrs. Paley, are you sure
you didn't leave the dog at home?

710
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:40,966
No. He was right here. I'm such an idiot.

711
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:43,535
This breaks my heart.

712
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:45,870
Mrs. Paley...

713
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,273
Mrs. Paley, what do you do for living?

714
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,475
Oh, nothing. I'm retired.

715
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:52,744
I shouldn't have let him off the leash.

716
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,547
Before you retired, what did you do?

717
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:58,719
Nothing very exciting.
I was a theoretical mathematician.

718
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,655
Where did you work?

719
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,757
Oh, my head hurts.

720
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,860
At Skippy Research Affiliates...

721
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,831
what do they called it?
A think-tank in Washington state.

722
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:16,001
She worked for Skippy Research Affiliates

723
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,969
and her dog's name was Izon?

724
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,205
- Mrs. Paley?
- Hmm?

725
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:25,010
Is it possible that you worked
for Izon Research Affiliates

726
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,317
and your dog's name is Skippy?

727
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,757
How did you know where I worked?

728
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,419
Oh, God.

729
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:36,388
She worked for a weapons manufacturer?

730
00:42:36,488 --> 00:42:39,224
She's a good friend of our Nobel wanna-be.

731
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:43,101
I don't think we should trust
Mrs. Funnyfarm.

732
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:47,609
I'm not crazy, and I'm not
hard of hearing either.

733
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:51,469
I told you no one would believe me.

734
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,805
Mrs. Paley,

735
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,274
what sort of research did you do at Izon?

736
00:42:56,374 --> 00:42:58,610
General, I will not be party
to this insanity!

737
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,944
I'm not a general.

738
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,113
I don't care what Alex Trusk says.

739
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:05,016
It's impossible.
And what's more, it's inhuman.

740
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:07,118
- Who's Alex?
- Did she say Alex Trusk?

741
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:10,388
Oh, Christ. We're dead.

742
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:12,257
This is really getting ridiculous.

743
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:13,858
Who's Alex Trusk?

744
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,429
Alex Trusk? Hacker extraordinare?
He's a legend.

745
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:20,865
This is exactly the kind
of twisted maze he'd create.

746
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,104
Alex Trusk doesn't even exist.

747
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:26,571
Some things should never be created.

748
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:29,541
They exist for theoretical purposes only.

749
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:33,978
It would never last.
Can't you understand that?

750
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:36,347
Okay, you're a shrink.

751
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:40,919
Can you tell me what the hell's happening?

752
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:42,387
I... umm...

753
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:44,923
I'd say that seeing the dead man

754
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,891
triggered some sort of emotional response.

755
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,494
Flashbacks, post-traumatic stress...

756
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:52,464
So she is connected to this, yeah?

757
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:54,165
Skippy...

758
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:58,336
Ooh, I think I hear him.

759
00:43:58,436 --> 00:43:59,804
Skippy?

760
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:02,040
Mrs. Paley, Mrs. Paley, don't...

761
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,341
Skippy?

762
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,043
Mrs. Paley.

763
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:11,284
Oh, my.

764
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:22,293
Help me, please.

765
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,565
No, don't trust the old cunt.

766
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,435
She's lying about everything.

767
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:36,840
What the... Jesus fucking Christ.

768
00:44:37,442 --> 00:44:40,480
What just happened?

769
00:44:41,246 --> 00:44:43,047
It took my head, man.

770
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,482
I lost my fucking head!

771
00:44:44,582 --> 00:44:47,285
Paley opened...

772
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:49,454
the portal...

773
00:44:57,962 --> 00:45:00,498
Wait, wait, I have an idea.

774
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:04,235
I think we're all tired.
We need to calm down, everybody.

775
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:07,572
Hold it. Wait a minute!

776
00:45:07,672 --> 00:45:09,140
I have an idea.

777
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,876
Let me guess, you designed the floor too.

778
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:14,245
You better have a really
good fucking explanation, Jerry.

779
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:16,848
I know what just
happened there was a little...

780
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:21,252
shocking, but it actually
makes total sense if we're...

781
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:23,755
in a really multi-dimensional
quantum environment.

782
00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:25,356
English, please.

783
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:29,294
One fundamental idea
of a quantum universe,

784
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:33,264
is that parallel realities
can actually exist simultaneously.

785
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:34,532
How do you know that, Jerry?

786
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:36,668
All you designed were the door panels!

787
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:38,336
I read it in Rosenzweig book,

788
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,305
it was a big part of this theory.

789
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:43,341
What if whoever designed
this stinking thing

790
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:46,511
somehow managed to create
a place where parallel realities

791
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:48,646
can crossover like that?

792
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,716
So you are saying
we just saw Simon and Mrs. Paley

793
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:53,685
- in a parallel universe?
- Yes, yes!

794
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:54,986
Stop it!

795
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,522
A universe where things
turn out a little differently.

796
00:45:57,622 --> 00:45:59,324
- Fuck.
- Uh, please.

797
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:01,259
Think about it, think about it.

798
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,228
A few minutes before,

799
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:05,029
- when you found the watch...
- Yeah.

800
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:06,931
...and we realized that somebody else

801
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:09,133
had been marking numbers
in the rooms, right?

802
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:12,070
That's when I thought maybe
we should leave markers behind,

803
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,439
in case we doubled back
and got side-tracked.

804
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:16,741
Things like a piece of clothing
or jewelry.

805
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:20,178
I think what a pity it would be
to leave my watch.

806
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,447
But I would do it if I had to.

807
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:25,216
You're saying that in an alternate reality

808
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:27,085
we'd already gotten ourselves
into such trouble

809
00:46:27,185 --> 00:46:29,120
that you decided that is okay
to leave your watch?

810
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,922
- Yes!
- For crying out loud!

811
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:32,092
What a load of crap!

812
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,559
There's got to be a logical explanation.

813
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:36,394
What would you think that is?

814
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:39,297
This is just an optical illusion
or something?

815
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:40,899
Yeah, sure. Why not?

816
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:43,268
Finally, yeah. A sane idea.

817
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:44,969
Oh, that's a sane idea.

818
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:45,970
All right.

819
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:49,140
If Max is right, why don't you
go and open that door?

820
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,009
- Oh, come on.
- Have a look.

821
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:52,076
Excuse me?

822
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,112
If you're so sure
it's an optical illusion,

823
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:56,158
open the door and have a look.

824
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,894
You might want to stand
to the side, in case that thing...

825
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,598
Fuck off, Jerry!

826
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,248
Okay, hold it!

827
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:25,512
All right? Don't open it.

828
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:29,614
Say Jerry's right,

829
00:47:29,714 --> 00:47:32,684
I think all of this is a hoax, okay?

830
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:35,753
I think Jerry's either full
of shit or part of this experiment.

831
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,989
- Simon, I never...
- Shut the fuck up!

832
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:39,891
I'm agreeing with you, Max.

833
00:47:39,991 --> 00:47:44,128
I think we're all pumped so full of LSD

834
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,597
and I think we're hidden
in some CIA hospital

835
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,366
in Area 51, or whatever.

836
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,134
But let's just say, on the off-chance

837
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:53,638
that Jerry is actually right.

838
00:47:53,738 --> 00:47:56,741
Then what happens if whatever
the fuck it was in there

839
00:47:56,841 --> 00:48:00,578
that killed the guy, killed me, what happens
if that fucking thing gets in here?

840
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:02,521
What happens then?

841
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:05,383
You're all crazy.

842
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:08,686
Hey, man, what are you doing?

843
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:10,888
Just don't fucking open the door.

844
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,057
What are you so scared of anyway?

845
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:16,260
I just saw my fucking head
taken off by something or other.

846
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,528
How's that for starters?

847
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,471
Where did you get that knife?

848
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,336
It's mine.

849
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:26,237
I collect knives.

850
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:28,740
He had it when I first saw him.

851
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,675
- He sure did.
- That's convenient.

852
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:32,577
He's the only guy with a knife here,

853
00:48:32,677 --> 00:48:35,246
if anyone was a part
of the experiment... maybe you.

854
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:38,516
I know! I know! I've got it! I've got it!

855
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:41,486
Why don't we all just

856
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,087
get some ice cream

857
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:46,361
and everyone will feel
a lot better about everything?

858
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:53,664
You're funny, Mrs. Paley.
You really are a funny old lady.

859
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,933
You're also cute and senile.

860
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,269
You leave her alone,
she doesn't understand.

861
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:01,339
All right, she's already admitted
working for Izon,

862
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,308
one of the most powerful weapons
manufacturers in the world.

863
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,644
She recognized the figures on the wall,

864
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:08,146
and she knew the dead guy.

865
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:11,449
No. Maybe my alter ego
wasn't all that wrong.

866
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:14,952
Maybe we shouldn't trust
dear old Mrs. Paley.

867
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,722
Maybe you're the one we shouldn't trust.

868
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:19,927
I beg your pardon?

869
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:25,329
Maybe you're the one we shouldn't trust.

870
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,331
Oh.

871
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,700
I'm going to ignore that, little girl,

872
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,609
because you're a cripple.

873
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:40,617
I think we should keep moving, huh?

874
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:44,151
After you.

875
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,406
Kate, I'm really thirsty.

876
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,578
Me too, sweetheart. Me too.

877
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:18,293
I'm exhausted. Are we there yet?

878
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,263
Come on, Mrs. Paley.
Just hold on a little longer.

879
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:43,574
Who's this Alex Trusk person?

880
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:45,109
Are you kidding?

881
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,445
He programmed the virus that crashed

882
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,181
the Tokyo stock exchange two years ago.

883
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:54,051
He's the one that broke into
the Air Traffic Control Grid,

884
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,521
and crashed those two
Air Force jets in Nevada

885
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:58,723
to protest military spending.

886
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:00,925
You forgot the one about Alex Trusk

887
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:03,594
being the first genetically
engineered superhuman,

888
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:07,031
bred in a test tube, who now
lives and walks amongst us.

889
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:09,634
That sounds a bit far-fetched.

890
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,002
Don't worry.

891
00:51:11,102 --> 00:51:14,572
Alex Trusk is a conspiracy
theorist's wet dream.

892
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:16,140
He doesn't exist.

893
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,843
Fine. Just keep fooling yourself.

894
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:22,152
Would you people
just shut up and keep moving?

895
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:28,352
Do you really believe this stuff

896
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,688
about parallel universes?

897
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:33,391
If you asked me yesterday, I'd say no.

898
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:37,098
But this place changes your
perception about what's possible.

899
00:52:41,459 --> 00:52:44,495
Look, let's just keep this
between us for now.

900
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:46,597
Yeah. Okay.

901
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,435
Here's the deal.
I'm a private investigator.

902
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:54,141
I'm on a case, missing persons.

903
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,343
Given our current situation,
this counts as irony.

904
00:52:59,443 --> 00:53:01,412
You're right.

905
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:04,548
I think they stuck me in here
because of her...

906
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:06,617
Becky Young.

907
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:11,255
They've emptied my pockets
except for my knife and this.

908
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,357
Maybe it's a message or a warning.

909
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:18,396
Here's the kicker.

910
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:20,874
Guess who she worked for?

911
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:27,207
Izon?

912
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:33,554
Kate.

913
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,524
Kate.

914
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:41,018
Kate, you have to wake up, there's...

915
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:42,820
What is it? What's wrong?

916
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,089
There's something here.

917
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:47,625
Do you see anything?

918
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,968
You're probably just dreaming or some...

919
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,600
Whoa.

920
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:56,901
There is...

921
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,869
there is something.

922
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,915
What the hell is that?

923
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:05,319
Kate.

924
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:09,413
Kate, what do you see?

925
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:12,650
It's a square. It's just floating.

926
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,385
What is it?

927
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:16,020
It's beautiful.

928
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,055
You recognize this too, Mrs. Paley?

929
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:20,091
Well, not exactly...

930
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:22,026
- What just happened?
- Now there's two.

931
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:23,160
It's multiplying.

932
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,930
- Oh, my God...
- Maybe it's the way out.

933
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,732
Oh. Wow.

934
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:30,401
If we're drunk,
I wanna know what this stuff is.

935
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:33,337
Maybe that's what a
four-dimensional object looks like.

936
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:36,316
If that's the way out, how do we use it?

937
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:41,515
I hate it. It sounds wrong.

938
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,716
It's stunning.

939
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:47,752
The math of it.

940
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:51,856
It's a perfect quadrangular oscillation.

941
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,958
It's moving. Mrs. Paley, no!

942
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,803
Ahh.

943
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,142
Get the fuck out of the way!

944
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:05,336
Jerry, you're hurt.

945
00:55:05,436 --> 00:55:07,004
No. I'm okay.

946
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:08,048
Look out.

947
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:12,744
Stay low.

948
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:16,447
Whoa! Go on.

949
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:18,584
Come on, Mrs. Paley. It's time to go.

950
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,895
Over here. It looks safe.

951
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,537
- Don't stare at it. Go.
- It's coming back.

952
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:36,801
Come on, Max.

953
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:38,402
Go, Julia. Go.

954
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,846
- I want to get it.
- No. We've got to go.

955
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,413
Oh, my God. Go. Go up the stairs.

956
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,488
Come on, Mrs. Paley. Keep going...

957
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,886
Kate!

958
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:56,887
Sasha.

959
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:01,859
Jerry.

960
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:03,563
- Oh, Jesus!
- No.

961
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:11,202
- Sasha.
- No. Just don't do it.

962
00:56:11,302 --> 00:56:13,337
- Just get in here.
- What the fuck are you doing?

963
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:14,405
Kate!

964
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:17,111
She's gone. You want to end up like Jerry?

965
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:21,218
- Sasha.
- Kate!

966
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,481
Kate, I'm here.

967
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:24,482
Kate.

968
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:26,391
You're a dead woman.

969
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:31,726
Oh... oh, Jesus.

970
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:36,231
Sasha.

971
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:39,565
Kate, help.

972
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:45,236
- Kate, help!
- I'm coming to get you.

973
00:56:45,336 --> 00:56:46,370
Help me!

974
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,279
Drop to the ground, Sasha. Now.

975
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:51,618
Help me.

976
00:56:54,345 --> 00:56:56,188
Okay, Sasha.

977
00:56:57,281 --> 00:57:00,284
Now... uh... I can see you, Sasha.

978
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:03,220
Flatten yourself
against the wall, on the ground.

979
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,823
- Crawl towards me.
- No. I can't. I'm scared.

980
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,492
You've gotta move,
or I can't come and get you.

981
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,661
Move towards me.

982
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:12,329
No. Stop, Sasha!

983
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,265
Don't, Sasha.

984
00:57:14,365 --> 00:57:15,309
Get down.

985
00:57:16,367 --> 00:57:18,502
Damn it, Kate, what do you want me to do?

986
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:21,672
Just keep moving until
you hit that corner,

987
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,007
and then stay put.

988
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:24,882
Okay?

989
00:57:26,377 --> 00:57:28,312
Sasha?

990
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:31,359
Okay? I'm almost there.

991
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,387
Just crawl on. Keep your side
to the ground. You can do it.

992
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:38,489
You've made it. I'm right behind you.

993
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:40,758
There you are. Keep your knees in.

994
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:43,327
Kate, thank God.

995
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:46,237
There you are. You're okay. You're okay...

996
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,152
What just happened?

997
00:58:08,252 --> 00:58:10,154
I don't know.

998
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:12,165
I don't know, Sasha.

999
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,141
Sweet Jesus.

1000
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,311
It's shrinking so it can get us.

1001
00:58:34,411 --> 00:58:36,080
Please let it be quick.

1002
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,247
Okay.

1003
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,416
We're going to make a run for it.

1004
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,885
- I can't.
- Yes you can. Just hold onto me.

1005
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,821
We're going to go to our right.

1006
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:46,090
No. We're going to go to the left.

1007
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,591
All right?

1008
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,126
- Okay?
- Okay.

1009
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:51,706
On the count of three...
just hold on to me.

1010
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:57,434
One, two, three...

1011
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,370
I've got you.

1012
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:00,671
Oh, my God!

1013
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:01,749
Sasha, no.

1014
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,673
It responds to our movements.

1015
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:37,753
Don't move.

1016
00:59:39,877 --> 00:59:41,879
Stay still.

1017
00:59:41,979 --> 00:59:43,458
Don't...

1018
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,460
Oh, my God.

1019
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,629
Is it gone?

1020
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:00,664
Yeah. It's gone.

1021
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:01,970
Thank you.

1022
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:06,070
We did it together. Let's get out
of here before it comes back.

1023
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,137
My glasses.

1024
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:09,673
You're glasses are gone.
Just go up the ladder.

1025
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:12,209
- Kate.
- Yeah? What?

1026
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:14,111
- I can smell it.
- What?

1027
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:16,113
Did someone die in here?

1028
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:17,783
Yeah.

1029
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:22,286
- Yeah. Jerry died.
- Oh, no.

1030
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:24,923
He was so nice.

1031
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,660
We've got to go. We've got to go, honey.

1032
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,762
Just get up there.
One foot after the other.

1033
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:34,498
- Where are the others?
- I think we're on our own.

1034
01:00:34,598 --> 01:00:35,975
You're doing good.

1035
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:01,169
I see a pattern.

1036
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,438
Anyone connected to this...

1037
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:07,842
this hypercube...

1038
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,568
eventually dies a very violent,

1039
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,841
and painful death.

1040
01:01:21,945 --> 01:01:25,916
I would hate for that
to happen to you, Mrs. Paley.

1041
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,853
I would.

1042
01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:31,522
So drop the act

1043
01:01:31,622 --> 01:01:34,691
and tell us how we get out of here.

1044
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,860
Huh?

1045
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,028
Simon.

1046
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:39,429
Simon, that's enough.

1047
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,098
- Shut up.
- Hey, Simon...

1048
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,734
- Shut up.
- Okay.

1049
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:48,974
Okay, Mrs. Paley. You ready to talk?

1050
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:52,951
'Cause I'm all ears.

1051
01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:58,348
I really don't need
this operation, Doctor.

1052
01:01:58,448 --> 01:01:59,950
I'm in perfect health.

1053
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,553
Just ask my daughter-in-law
over there. She'll explain.

1054
01:02:02,653 --> 01:02:04,221
This joke's really getting stale.

1055
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:07,724
I'm going to give you one
more chance, Mrs. Paley.

1056
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:09,760
You tell me what I need to know,

1057
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,728
or I'm going to have to kill you.

1058
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:14,631
Do you understand? I'm going to kill you.

1059
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,433
It's your choice.

1060
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:18,135
Get away from her!

1061
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:21,038
You have a choice to make. Right now.

1062
01:02:21,138 --> 01:02:23,440
Do you want to get out of here or not?

1063
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,642
- Yes, but...
- There are no buts!

1064
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,415
Hey guys, maybe...

1065
01:02:29,046 --> 01:02:30,581
All right.

1066
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:33,150
Oh, shit.

1067
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,818
It's here.

1068
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,955
It's gonna take my head off.

1069
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:40,657
Let's go.

1070
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,492
What about Mrs. Paley?

1071
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,661
Goddamn it.

1072
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,231
- I'm not gonna die here.
- You can't leave her.

1073
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:50,067
- Why should I help her?
- She'll die.

1074
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:52,135
- Forget about her.
- I'm gonna regret this.

1075
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:53,470
Julia!

1076
01:02:54,705 --> 01:02:57,674
- I'm trying to get this off.
- Come on. Hurry.

1077
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,977
Shit! Would someone give me a hand?

1078
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:01,852
Would somebody help me pick her up?

1079
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,348
Shit!

1080
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:06,083
Let go of me.

1081
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:07,084
Shit!

1082
01:03:07,184 --> 01:03:09,853
I'm not staying here. I'm out of here.

1083
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:11,121
Let go of me.

1084
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:12,700
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my God.

1085
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:21,408
Oh, God.

1086
01:03:43,787 --> 01:03:45,455
Where do you think you're going?

1087
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:46,966
Hurry up.

1088
01:03:50,594 --> 01:03:52,574
Get back here.

1089
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:09,957
What the hell?

1090
01:04:27,798 --> 01:04:29,709
6-0-6-5-9.

1091
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,971
It could mean anything.

1092
01:04:34,071 --> 01:04:35,872
Right.

1093
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:39,443
Maybe it's a coordinate of
some kind but in four dimensions.

1094
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:40,744
Some...

1095
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:42,446
I don't know.

1096
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:44,047
For all we know,

1097
01:04:44,147 --> 01:04:46,183
it could be somebody's birthday,

1098
01:04:46,283 --> 01:04:47,884
or a zip code,

1099
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,362
or just a serial number.

1100
01:04:52,856 --> 01:04:55,302
I wish I was just... smarter.

1101
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:02,002
Why do you think you're in here?

1102
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:05,702
I don't know.

1103
01:05:05,802 --> 01:05:08,248
Maybe I was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

1104
01:05:09,873 --> 01:05:13,110
Damn it. There's got to be
some sort of meaning to this.

1105
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:17,647
6-0-6-5-9.

1106
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,990
Maybe they just like to watch us squirm.

1107
01:05:30,994 --> 01:05:35,399
Alex Trusk is the only one
with the resources

1108
01:05:35,499 --> 01:05:38,535
and brains to create something like this.

1109
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:40,637
Okay, Max. Say you're right.

1110
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:43,907
Say it is Alex Trusk who's
responsible for all of this.

1111
01:05:44,007 --> 01:05:46,209
Does it help us get out?

1112
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:49,279
No, we're still stuck here, with no clue.

1113
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:53,784
And if this is someone's game,
it isn't a fair one.

1114
01:05:53,884 --> 01:05:56,455
Max, do you think...

1115
01:05:58,155 --> 01:06:01,329
We've got to keep moving. Come on.

1116
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:05,470
Max?

1117
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:13,170
Max, what's wrong with you?

1118
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:31,354
Holy shit! Variable time-speed rooms.

1119
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:34,825
- Pretty wild.
- I guess you could say that.

1120
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:57,581
Holy jumping Jesus!

1121
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:59,483
Get your hands off me.

1122
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:01,384
- Hello, Jerry.
- Who the hell are you?

1123
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,053
- You don't recognize me?
- Where am I?

1124
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:05,522
- How do you know my name?
- You don't know me?

1125
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:07,390
No. Where the hell am I?

1126
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,492
You don't...?

1127
01:07:08,592 --> 01:07:09,593
Wait, wait.

1128
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:12,229
You don't remember me?

1129
01:07:12,329 --> 01:07:14,898
- No.
- What about the senile old broad,

1130
01:07:14,998 --> 01:07:17,100
- or the little blind kid?
- What?

1131
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,603
Or that thing that chopped
you up like little pieces

1132
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,538
of deli fucking meat?

1133
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:24,307
I'm a friend... I mean you no harm.

1134
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:26,877
Let me go, and I'll be on my way.

1135
01:07:26,977 --> 01:07:28,547
No come on, you...

1136
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:33,627
You mean me no harm?
You're fucking hilarious, Jerry.

1137
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:37,120
How long have you been in here?

1138
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,791
I don't know. I just woke up.

1139
01:07:40,857 --> 01:07:42,659
You just woke up?

1140
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:44,728
Holy shit!

1141
01:07:44,828 --> 01:07:46,563
Holy shit.

1142
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:48,798
Maybe you were right before, huh?

1143
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,868
You or the... whatever...

1144
01:07:51,968 --> 01:07:56,373
This place does crossover
parallel alternate realities, huh?

1145
01:07:56,473 --> 01:07:58,749
Have you been drinking?

1146
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:05,081
I really don't give a shit anymore.

1147
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:07,889
We are talking about alternate realities.

1148
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:15,292
Can I ask you a question?

1149
01:08:15,392 --> 01:08:16,893
Do you mind?

1150
01:08:16,993 --> 01:08:19,062
Yeah, okay, sure...

1151
01:08:19,162 --> 01:08:21,369
just don't hurt me, huh?

1152
01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:25,468
Are you hungry?

1153
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:27,605
Are you... hungry?

1154
01:08:31,308 --> 01:08:34,812
Yeah, I guess... my stomach's...

1155
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,983
'Cause I am hungry.

1156
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:43,121
I'm fucking starving.

1157
01:09:23,393 --> 01:09:24,997
Oh, my God.

1158
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:29,770
Kate, what is it?

1159
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:41,344
Kate?

1160
01:09:41,444 --> 01:09:43,287
What do you see?

1161
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:54,802
Kate, what's going on?

1162
01:09:56,593 --> 01:09:58,766
I don't know. I mean...

1163
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:04,305
I think in some other reality,
things didn't turn out so well.

1164
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:19,749
Again with the Alex Trusk?

1165
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:22,185
Why are you so afraid of this Alex Trusk?

1166
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:26,356
Because he's ruthless.
He's a hi-tech genius

1167
01:10:26,456 --> 01:10:28,358
whose morals make Muammar Qaddafi

1168
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:30,193
look like Mother Teresa.

1169
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:32,028
Why are you panicking?

1170
01:10:32,128 --> 01:10:36,166
Because he's throwing anybody
connected to this thing in here

1171
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:38,535
to fucking die!

1172
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:40,637
Max, you're not connected.

1173
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:49,955
Can you keep a secret?

1174
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,557
Sure. I love secrets.

1175
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:58,455
I designed a computer game
called "Relativity,"

1176
01:10:58,555 --> 01:11:02,592
where contestants linked
to each over the Internet

1177
01:11:02,692 --> 01:11:05,028
do battle in a 3-D environment,

1178
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:07,540
using different time signatures.

1179
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:10,633
What are you saying?

1180
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:13,603
Are you saying that you designed all this?

1181
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:15,739
No. Just these variable time speeds rooms.

1182
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:17,574
Just the concept.

1183
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:20,377
It was for a game. Now here we are.

1184
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:21,378
Wow.

1185
01:11:21,478 --> 01:11:23,380
This is really some game, Max.

1186
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,683
Do you have other little secrets
you want to tell me?

1187
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:28,284
People are dead, okay?

1188
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,153
I'm not responsible for this.

1189
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:32,155
It was just a game.

1190
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:34,324
I can't even sell the stupid thing.

1191
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:36,693
It's all involved in a lawsuit.

1192
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,728
What kind of lawsuit?

1193
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:40,430
I don't know, some...

1194
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,737
Right, you're a lawyer.

1195
01:11:44,534 --> 01:11:47,538
A company called Cyber Thrill
stole it from me.

1196
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:50,573
Cyber Thrill?

1197
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:52,942
You've heard of them?

1198
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:54,277
Yeah.

1199
01:11:54,377 --> 01:11:56,357
Are you into computer games?

1200
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:00,350
Settle.

1201
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,185
Excuse me?

1202
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:06,723
I strongly recommend that
you settle. You'll never win.

1203
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:09,993
- How do you know that?
- Because...

1204
01:12:10,093 --> 01:12:12,362
you're not up against Cyber Thrill.

1205
01:12:12,462 --> 01:12:14,531
They're just a subsidiary.

1206
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:16,766
Who owns them?

1207
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:18,468
Izon.

1208
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:21,171
How do you know that?

1209
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:23,473
Because I...

1210
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:25,519
represent them.

1211
01:13:01,311 --> 01:13:03,723
I must be hearing things.

1212
01:13:20,296 --> 01:13:21,197
Finally.

1213
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:23,800
I was wondering if I was
the only one in here.

1214
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,469
Do you need a hand there?

1215
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,304
You are upside-down.

1216
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:32,041
Do you have any idea what's going on here?

1217
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,710
Be careful. Watch your step.

1218
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:36,086
Crazy.

1219
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,048
You are not the only person here, Jerry.

1220
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:41,985
There's lots of people just like you.

1221
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:44,292
How do you know my name?

1222
01:13:46,222 --> 01:13:48,057
We've met before, Jerry.

1223
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:51,394
I get this mouth-watering feeling
when I talk to you.

1224
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:54,464
- What do you mean?
- Come here, look at this.

1225
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:55,665
Hey, hey. Agh!

1226
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:58,968
- Agh, no!
- Take this! And this!

1227
01:14:04,307 --> 01:14:06,743
Why don't you just go?

1228
01:14:06,843 --> 01:14:08,878
I'm blind, Kate.

1229
01:14:08,978 --> 01:14:11,014
I'm a burden.

1230
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:14,284
You can move faster without me.

1231
01:14:14,384 --> 01:14:16,719
Sasha, please, I know how you're feeling.

1232
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,923
No you don't.
You have no idea how I'm feeling.

1233
01:14:20,023 --> 01:14:22,392
- I know this seems hopeless.
- It is hopeless.

1234
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:25,295
No, it's not. I'm gonna figure this out.

1235
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:32,035
"Figure it out."

1236
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:33,970
Trust me, precious.

1237
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,905
If I haven't figured it out,

1238
01:14:36,005 --> 01:14:39,108
you sure as shit aren't going to.

1239
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,154
What did you just say?

1240
01:14:42,745 --> 01:14:44,847
I'm sorry, Kate. I didn't mean to...

1241
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:46,182
No, no. Wait a second.

1242
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:48,284
Back that up.

1243
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:52,088
Why do you think that you should be able

1244
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:54,429
to figure this out?

1245
01:14:57,794 --> 01:14:59,762
I wasn't kidnapped.

1246
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:03,633
When I found out they were
putting people in here,

1247
01:15:03,733 --> 01:15:05,868
I tried to blow the whistle on them.

1248
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:07,904
So they came after me.

1249
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:11,941
I escaped into the one place
they wouldn't dare follow me...

1250
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:13,977
in here.

1251
01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:17,149
Poetic justice, don't you think?

1252
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:22,685
Who are you?

1253
01:15:22,785 --> 01:15:25,421
Max was right.

1254
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,624
Jerry was wrong.

1255
01:15:27,724 --> 01:15:29,626
I exist.

1256
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:31,861
Oh, my God.

1257
01:15:31,961 --> 01:15:33,863
Sasha. Of course.

1258
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:36,065
Sasha is the nickname for Alexandra.

1259
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:38,301
Alex Trusk.

1260
01:15:38,401 --> 01:15:41,382
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

1261
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:48,811
Damn it.

1262
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:52,148
This is the worst nightmare I've ever had.

1263
01:15:52,248 --> 01:15:54,784
I just I wish I'd wake up.

1264
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,520
You really think this is all a dream?

1265
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:22,478
Definitely.

1266
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,218
In the real world I'd never kiss you.

1267
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:28,254
Oh, really?

1268
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:31,824
Yeah, you're not my type.

1269
01:16:33,523 --> 01:16:35,469
You're not my type, either.

1270
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,463
Becky Young.

1271
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:48,974
Yeah.

1272
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,035
Rebecca Young.

1273
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:54,637
Yeah.

1274
01:17:54,737 --> 01:17:57,411
Who... are you?

1275
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:04,180
Who am I? I'm Simon Grady.

1276
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:07,784
Your parents hired me to find you.

1277
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:09,552
- Really?
- Yeah.

1278
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:11,621
Thank God.

1279
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:12,989
Yeah.

1280
01:18:13,089 --> 01:18:16,993
I'm happy to see you too, Becky.
I really am.

1281
01:18:17,093 --> 01:18:20,129
I've been wandering these rooms for hours.

1282
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:22,843
Agh!

1283
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:35,781
You gotta love these parallel universes.

1284
01:18:38,114 --> 01:18:40,950
You built this thing?

1285
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,152
I gave them the key to build it...

1286
01:18:43,252 --> 01:18:45,087
better than they wanted.

1287
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:47,256
I gave them a real hypercube.

1288
01:18:47,356 --> 01:18:48,858
How do we get out?

1289
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:52,607
Kate, this isn't a game.
There's no happy ending.

1290
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:57,438
This place is out of control.
It's not stable.

1291
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:01,037
Does this number mean nothing?

1292
01:19:01,137 --> 01:19:03,539
6-0-6-5-9. It's got to mean something.

1293
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:05,541
It's everywhere.

1294
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:08,978
I'm sorry, Kate. It's over.

1295
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,347
No, it is not over.

1296
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:13,358
Not yet.

1297
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,473
I refuse to die here.

1298
01:19:33,903 --> 01:19:35,814
What the hell?

1299
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:51,220
Oh, my God. We've got to move.

1300
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,189
Come on. We've got to get out of here.

1301
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,462
- Leave me.
- No, you're coming with me.

1302
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:58,828
Oh, my God.

1303
01:19:58,928 --> 01:20:00,863
We got to get out of here.

1304
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:03,633
Just go up as fast as you can.

1305
01:20:03,733 --> 01:20:05,935
Faster, faster. Keep going.

1306
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:08,845
Okay. Good girl.

1307
01:20:13,576 --> 01:20:15,112
What the hell?

1308
01:20:16,512 --> 01:20:18,321
Oh, my God.

1309
01:20:19,715 --> 01:20:21,991
Okay, we've got to get out of here.

1310
01:20:28,758 --> 01:20:30,601
This is insane.

1311
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,709
It's Jerry's diagram.

1312
01:20:44,807 --> 01:20:46,684
It's all the numbers.

1313
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:58,897
They're all just suddenly in here.

1314
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,829
It's Jerry's markings...

1315
01:21:06,262 --> 01:21:09,573
that dead physicist's equations...

1316
01:21:12,101 --> 01:21:13,436
and that damn colonel's corpse,

1317
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:17,313
just hanging there as if
we never even rescued him?

1318
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:24,054
Everything keeps appearing
over and over again.

1319
01:21:26,148 --> 01:21:27,717
Sasha...

1320
01:21:27,817 --> 01:21:31,787
please, you have to have
some idea what this means.

1321
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,056
All the realities are starting to collapse

1322
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:36,192
into one space.

1323
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:40,196
And what happens to us
when they... "it" collapses?

1324
01:21:40,296 --> 01:21:42,932
The whole thing implodes.

1325
01:21:43,032 --> 01:21:46,202
It's only a matter of time.

1326
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:50,444
I'm not gonna just stand here
while it happens.

1327
01:21:54,677 --> 01:21:57,179
I'm not leaving him behind.

1328
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:59,782
- Oh, my God.
- Kate!

1329
01:21:59,882 --> 01:22:02,952
- Let me go.
- Get the hell up here!

1330
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:04,987
Oh, my God.

1331
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,756
Kate.

1332
01:22:06,856 --> 01:22:08,858
We don't have much time.

1333
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:31,647
No. I refuse to die here.

1334
01:22:31,747 --> 01:22:33,716
I wish I had your spirit.

1335
01:22:33,816 --> 01:22:35,718
Hello, gorgeous. Miss me?

1336
01:22:35,818 --> 01:22:37,386
Huh? Come on in.

1337
01:22:37,486 --> 01:22:39,432
The water's fine.

1338
01:22:40,489 --> 01:22:41,524
Agh!

1339
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:47,963
Hello, Kate.

1340
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:49,498
Let her go.

1341
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:51,635
Who are you?

1342
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:55,773
Yeah, it's me...

1343
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,575
good old Simon.

1344
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:02,978
Do you remember this? Do you?

1345
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:05,684
I've waited a long time for pay back.

1346
01:23:06,949 --> 01:23:09,018
That was just... seconds ago.

1347
01:23:09,118 --> 01:23:10,820
Don't be so stupid, Kate.

1348
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:14,094
Time works differently in this place.

1349
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:18,861
Hey, just... okay.

1350
01:23:18,961 --> 01:23:21,664
Just let her go. She's just a kid.

1351
01:23:21,764 --> 01:23:25,501
She'll be a dead little kid,
unless you come here to papa.

1352
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:26,969
Okay.

1353
01:23:27,069 --> 01:23:29,805
Just let her go...

1354
01:23:29,905 --> 01:23:32,784
we can figure something out, okay?

1355
01:23:34,643 --> 01:23:36,953
You take her place.

1356
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:41,851
What do you want?

1357
01:23:41,951 --> 01:23:44,620
I'm hungry.

1358
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,723
- Simon?
- Huh?

1359
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:50,269
There's no point.

1360
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:54,029
We're all dead anyway.

1361
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:56,298
Oh, oh.

1362
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:58,071
Okay.

1363
01:23:59,602 --> 01:24:00,672
No!

1364
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,958
Oh, come on Kate.

1365
01:24:15,684 --> 01:24:17,823
The fun's just beginning.

1366
01:24:18,254 --> 01:24:20,063
Oh, my God.

1367
01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:29,570
What the hell?

1368
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,474
- Yah!
- Agh!

1369
01:24:46,315 --> 01:24:49,194
I'm really gonna miss you.

1370
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:06,208
Jesus...

1371
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:13,108
Of course,

1372
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:15,911
6-0-6-5-9.

1373
01:25:16,011 --> 01:25:18,013
It's an expiration date.

1374
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:20,923
He figured out when it's gonna implode.

1375
01:27:58,006 --> 01:27:59,917
Leave me.

1376
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:12,959
Hello, Kate. Welcome back.

1377
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,793
So, you figured it out.

1378
01:28:17,893 --> 01:28:20,129
Yes, sir.

1379
01:28:20,229 --> 01:28:22,106
No time to spare.

1380
01:28:24,366 --> 01:28:26,539
The device... any luck?

1381
01:28:46,188 --> 01:28:50,136
We'll take that to Darcy and see
if anything recorded on it.

1382
01:29:17,286 --> 01:29:18,587
Sir?

1383
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:20,322
Yes, sir.

1384
01:29:20,422 --> 01:29:22,732
Phase two is terminated.

1385
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:27,736
I see.

1386
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:30,899
Yes, sir.

1387
01:29:30,999 --> 01:29:32,637
Right away, sir.
