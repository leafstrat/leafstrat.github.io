02:13.000 --> 02:14.206
Hello?

02:18.439 --> 02:19.577
Anyone here?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.225
Hello.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.303
Numbers...

06:01.595 --> 06:04.269
where's the goddamn numbers?

06:15.108 --> 06:16.678
There's something...

06:21.715 --> 06:23.752
Oh, shit.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.097
I mean, they're my numbers...

06:37.197 --> 06:39.867
Damn! Don't I at least
get a shot with my numbers,

06:39.967 --> 06:41.535
you stupid fucks?

06:41.635 --> 06:44.138
I want a chance!

06:46.440 --> 06:48.579
I want a chance like everyone else.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.057
Oh, my God.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.569
Oh, you bastards.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.902
Our Father Which art in heaven,

07:15.002 --> 07:16.481
hallowed be Thy name.

07:18.905 --> 07:21.742
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,

07:21.842 --> 07:23.677
on earth as it is in heaven.

07:23.777 --> 07:27.080
Give us this day our daily bread,

07:27.180 --> 07:29.683
and forgive us our debts
as we forgive our debtors.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.397
Lead us not into temptation...

07:34.821 --> 07:37.624
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.126
For Thine...

07:39.226 --> 07:40.193
is the kingdom...

07:40.293 --> 07:42.362
and the power...

07:42.462 --> 07:45.238
and the glory, forever and ever.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.537
Amen.

07:56.543 --> 07:57.647
Hello?

08:01.048 --> 08:02.322
Are you all right?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.654
Can you hear me?

08:14.961 --> 08:16.440
Are you hurt?

08:27.140 --> 08:28.847
Don't move. Don't make a sound.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.148
I said, "Don't move."

08:34.815 --> 08:36.055
Are you alone?

08:37.384 --> 08:38.685
Blink once for yes,

08:38.785 --> 08:39.786
twice for no.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.295
Is there anyone else in the other room?

08:47.227 --> 08:48.501
All right.

08:49.563 --> 08:51.008
All right. I'm going to release you.

08:52.499 --> 08:55.002
But I can take you down again,
as quick as the first time.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.770
So don't scream, understand?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.539
Once for yes, twice for no.

08:59.639 --> 09:02.176
Are you alone?

09:05.212 --> 09:08.750
All right.

09:15.522 --> 09:16.990
What the hell do you think you're doing?

09:17.090 --> 09:19.593
How many rooms have you been in?

09:20.660 --> 09:21.962
What is this place?

09:22.062 --> 09:23.964
I don't know. You tell me,
how many rooms you've been in?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.932
I don't know, five or six. What about you?

09:26.032 --> 09:28.135
Uh... this is my third.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.736
You sure you didn't see anyone else?

09:29.836 --> 09:30.737
No.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.005
Have you?

09:32.105 --> 09:33.448
No.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.210
So who are you?

09:37.310 --> 09:39.046
Who are you?

09:39.946 --> 09:42.358
What the fuck are those noises?

09:44.351 --> 09:47.554
Relax. This is just for show.
Pretend that you're scared.

09:47.654 --> 09:48.922
Should be easy.

09:49.022 --> 09:52.094
All right. Get down here now,
or she's dead.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.463
Some hero.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.065
I have that effect on men.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.996
Glad to see you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.342
- Is this really necessary?
- Just hang on.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.940
- Isn't that the same...
- Yes.

10:08.642 --> 10:11.244
Hey! Come back!

10:13.446 --> 10:14.981
Wait.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.450
Jesus Christ.

10:16.550 --> 10:18.385
Hey! Wait!

10:18.485 --> 10:20.220
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

10:20.320 --> 10:23.490
This guy sure moves quickly.
He's just gone.

10:23.590 --> 10:26.935
Maybe something made him go,
maybe you should come back.

10:35.001 --> 10:37.345
This place is awful.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.078
Please don't hurt me.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.252
Don't be frightened.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.585
Don't worry.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.029
There's nobody else here. Just me.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.391
I'm Kate.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.560
What's your name?

11:33.660 --> 11:36.698
Sasha.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.367
That's a beautiful name.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.403
Don't worry.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.744
Everything's going to be all right, okay?

11:48.408 --> 11:49.887
Do you understand me?

11:51.711 --> 11:55.748
I'm just blind, not retarded.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.233
Finally.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.569
I was beginning to wonder
if I was the only one in here.

12:15.669 --> 12:18.171
I kept hoping I would
find some other people.

12:18.271 --> 12:21.575
I've been wondering around
these rooms for hours.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.276
Stay away from me!

12:23.376 --> 12:24.344
No one's going to hurt you.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.378
Well, certainly not.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.648
No. No. I come in peace, young lady.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.083
I'm Jerry.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.452
This is Sasha. She's blind.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.020
And she's very scared.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.958
What a bummer, to be blind in this place.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.160
Do you know what this place is?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.962
No. No. No.

12:42.062 --> 12:46.199
I don't suppose, either of you two could
let me know what we're doing in here?

12:46.299 --> 12:47.369
No.

12:50.236 --> 12:51.972
Oh... Jerry Whitehall.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.052
Kate Filmore.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.380
What are you doing?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.048
I'm marking the rooms.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.217
This is the fourth room you've been in?

13:04.317 --> 13:05.218
Yeah.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.654
I thought you said you've been
wandering these rooms for hours.

13:07.754 --> 13:10.223
Yeah. That's the weird thing isn't it?

13:10.323 --> 13:14.160
Each one of these rooms, has six
of these doors, or portals.

13:14.260 --> 13:17.030
But no matter how many portals
I go through,

13:17.130 --> 13:18.999
I always wound up in the same three rooms.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.734
Until now.

13:20.834 --> 13:23.637
It's as if the rooms
were moving around or something.

13:23.737 --> 13:26.740
Yeah. But I don't feel any motion, do you?

13:26.840 --> 13:27.741
No.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.376
It's just so strange.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.729
I ran into this guy...

13:33.580 --> 13:35.649
Oh, no. It's getting closer!

13:35.749 --> 13:38.051
- What is?
- I don't know.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.520
Something's coming after us,
and I don't think it likes us.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.789
I don't hear any people.
I think it's just motors.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.926
He wants us dead. We have
to get out of here right now.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.127
Any suggestion on which way to go next?

13:47.227 --> 13:48.995
Your guess is as good as mine.
I don't know.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.064
Please, we have to move!

13:51.164 --> 13:52.299
Uh... here.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.735
Okay. Sasha, we're going to have
to climb a bit of a ladder.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.970
Hold on to me.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.310
- Move quickly.
- Get me out of here!

13:59.339 --> 14:00.974
Help!

14:01.074 --> 14:03.310
- Help me!
- Oh, God!

14:03.410 --> 14:05.856
There's a guy hanging.

14:06.913 --> 14:08.815
I can't hold him much longer!

14:08.915 --> 14:10.050
- Okay. I'm coming.
- Oh, my God.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.584
What's happening?

14:11.684 --> 14:13.163
Hurry!

14:14.454 --> 14:16.122
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

14:16.222 --> 14:17.424
Grab his...

14:17.524 --> 14:18.558
I'm coming. I'm coming.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.331
Here...

14:21.995 --> 14:22.896
Good girl. Good girl.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.065
Sasha, you're going to be okay.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.534
Just stay here. You're going to be okay.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.839
There you are.
You've found some friends, huh?

14:32.939 --> 14:33.840
Help me get him down.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.920
Fantastic.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.680
- Give me some space.
- I'm here.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.082
- I can grab his legs.
- I'm loosening the belt.

14:42.182 --> 14:46.353
- All right. All right. I got him.
- I'm losing it.

14:46.453 --> 14:47.153
Ready, you got it?

14:47.253 --> 14:48.722
- Yeah.
- Hurry.

14:48.822 --> 14:49.994
There it goes.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.772
I know you want a cigarette, but not yet.

14:56.329 --> 14:59.332
- Slowly. Easy.
- I've got his legs.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.201
Lean him up against this wall.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.103
Okay. Watch his head.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.471
That's it.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.380
Just make sure he's upright.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.381
He's alive.

15:11.010 --> 15:11.911
He's breathing.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.346
Good.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.347
He's military.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.649
Colonel Thomas H. Maguire,
Department of Defense,

15:16.749 --> 15:18.618
Jesus Christ.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.087
He's Pentagon, hi-tech liaison.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.422
You...

15:22.522 --> 15:24.001
how the hell would you know?

15:25.058 --> 15:27.227
A buddy of mine's doing 10-20 upstate

15:27.327 --> 15:29.829
for cracking the mainframe
on the Pentagon two years ago.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.766
I helped him write the code.
Maybe that's why I'm in here.

15:32.866 --> 15:34.968
You know for sure we're in prison?

15:35.068 --> 15:37.804
- I'm assuming...
- You know what they say.

15:41.407 --> 15:43.076
Thanks. That's helpful.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.278
Jerry Whitehall. Thanks.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.880
Simon Grady.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.481
That's Kate.

15:48.581 --> 15:49.582
Sasha.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.753
I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.

15:53.553 --> 15:54.687
Max Reisler.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.266
- Thanks.
- Sasha...

16:00.760 --> 16:02.162
Sasha...

16:02.262 --> 16:03.163
Jerry, could you...

16:03.263 --> 16:05.231
Sure, of course.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.667
Come on, sit him up.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.537
Let's get you sitting up straight here.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.584
Sasha, you okay?

16:15.308 --> 16:16.776
This man's been beaten badly.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.978
He's been tortured.

16:19.078 --> 16:20.921
Look at his hand.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.117
- Cigarette burns.
- Jesus.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.653
They're coming for us next.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.355
Don't you worry.
I won't let anyone hurt you.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.492
I hope it's that easy, Kate.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.863
There's nothing in here.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.976
What do you think?

16:41.501 --> 16:44.737
I figure he knows something
he didn't want anyone to know.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.407
That's usually why people are tortured.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.876
How do you know, Mr. Cigarette Burns?

16:49.976 --> 16:51.614
What are you, an expert?

16:55.215 --> 16:57.350
As a matter of fact,
you weedy little shit...

17:04.090 --> 17:07.060
They're coming! They're coming!

17:07.160 --> 17:08.833
They're coming. They're coming.

17:10.095 --> 17:11.865
Oh, hello.

17:11.965 --> 17:14.134
Do you know where the showers are?

17:14.234 --> 17:16.436
I seem to be lost, again.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.072
I always get lost in this gym.

17:19.172 --> 17:22.208
I don't know why my daughter-in-law
insists on bringing me here.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.511
- It's all the way across town.
- Whoa.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.945
Watch your step. Watch your step.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.581
Thank you, dear.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.558
Oh, my goodness.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.020
I'm afraid I can't help you
with the showers.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.488
I'm Jerry.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.725
You're not little Jerry Reisback, are you?

17:38.825 --> 17:40.193
No.

17:40.293 --> 17:43.934
Thank goodness. He's my paperboy,
and I owe him $10.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.769
Right. Well, this is Simon.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.238
Kate and Sasha.

17:52.338 --> 17:53.239
Hello.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.108
And uh...

17:55.208 --> 17:57.944
Max.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.312
- Max.
- And you are?

17:59.412 --> 18:00.880
I'm Mrs. Paley.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.315
How do you do Mrs. Paley?

18:02.415 --> 18:05.552
You don't happen to know
why you're here, do you?

18:05.652 --> 18:09.188
Oh, dear. I was never
very good at philosophy.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.869
Do any of us know what's going on here?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.208
Sorry.

18:20.033 --> 18:23.640
I've been trying to get a handle
on the configuration of these rooms.

18:24.671 --> 18:25.738
All I can say is...

18:25.838 --> 18:27.373
They just don't make any sense.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.409
That's right. They sure don't.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.579
It's as if the rooms
are moving around very quickly.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.614
There's got to be
some kind of logic to it.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.216
These rooms just seem to repeat.

18:37.316 --> 18:40.553
You go in one direction,
the room just loops back on itself.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.690
It's getting closer.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.659
Sasha, do you know what it is?

18:46.759 --> 18:48.628
Not really.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.463
But I can hear it.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.966
All the time, even when you don't.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.168
And it sounds...

18:55.268 --> 18:58.181
it feels wrong.

18:59.838 --> 19:02.185
Maybe we're in hell.

19:04.010 --> 19:04.954
All right,

19:06.746 --> 19:08.453
let's get some real answers.

19:09.515 --> 19:10.883
His answer was suicide.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.419
Not exactly a comforting thought.

19:13.519 --> 19:15.788
Soldier, up on your feet.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.624
Careful, he's hurt.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.325
Come on, pumpkin, up you come.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.294
Stop it. He's in serious condition.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.395
Stop it.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.931
- Listen to me, sweetheart...
- I'm not your sweetheart, asshole.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.733
All right. This man's been tortured.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.101
You want to be next when they come for us?

19:28.201 --> 19:29.168
Who exactly are they?

19:29.268 --> 19:30.770
Well, I'm going to find out. Come on.

19:30.870 --> 19:34.140
Stop it. Stop it.
Are you trying to kill us?

19:34.240 --> 19:35.842
It's not going to help us
if he dies, you know?

19:35.942 --> 19:37.444
You've got no information whatsoever.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.652
- It's here.
- Jesus...

19:45.752 --> 19:47.053
what the fuck?

19:47.153 --> 19:49.055
Come on.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.257
- He's conscious.
- Sit him up. Sit him up.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.459
Come on, soldier. Talk to me, soldier.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.361
Talk to me. What's going on here?

19:55.461 --> 19:57.063
Are you speaking to me?

19:57.163 --> 19:58.464
Yes. Jesus Christ. Yes.

19:58.564 --> 20:00.199
Just tell me, how do we get out of here?

20:00.299 --> 20:01.901
I don't know.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.536
You figure out the code,

20:03.636 --> 20:05.405
you get out.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.573
The first one had rules...

20:07.673 --> 20:09.275
The first one? What are you talking about?

20:09.375 --> 20:10.910
Leave him alone. He's delirious.

20:11.010 --> 20:14.514
He knows something, all right?
I'll carry him myself, just...

20:14.614 --> 20:16.783
The first one had numbers...

20:16.883 --> 20:18.718
What do you mean, "the first one"?

20:18.818 --> 20:21.454
- Let him go.
- I'm out of here.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.462
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

20:29.562 --> 20:30.730
Did you hit your head?

20:30.830 --> 20:32.065
Yeah. I slipped.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.434
It's a wall. It wiggled.

20:34.534 --> 20:37.037
- You sure you're okay...
- Look. There it goes again.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.974
That... that... that...

20:42.074 --> 20:44.410
That's... that's... I don't know.

20:44.510 --> 20:45.454
No!

20:49.649 --> 20:51.151
Holy fuck.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.153
What is that?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.788
I don't know.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.623
But I don't think we should
stick around to find out.

20:57.723 --> 20:59.625
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.627
Come on, Sasha, I'm here.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.629
I'm right behind you, honey.

21:03.729 --> 21:04.764
Hurry, let's go!

21:04.864 --> 21:06.138
Easy, easy...

21:09.936 --> 21:11.537
For Christ's sake.

21:11.637 --> 21:12.809
What the...

21:16.409 --> 21:19.512
Come on. There you go.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.782
- Grab right there.
- Where are you?

21:22.882 --> 21:24.117
Come on, Colonel.

21:24.217 --> 21:26.085
It's time for us to go.
I'm not done with you yet.

21:26.185 --> 21:28.221
I'm not going.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.389
What did you do that for?

21:29.489 --> 21:30.957
I'm not going anywhere soon.

21:31.057 --> 21:31.958
Well, fuck you.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.025
Come on, Kate.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.260
Let's get out of here.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.695
Come on, where's the key?
Do you have the key?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.296
- You mean this?
- Yeah.

21:37.396 --> 21:39.265
No.

21:39.365 --> 21:40.366
What did you do that for?

21:40.466 --> 21:44.137
You don't honestly think you can escape?

21:44.237 --> 21:45.181
We have to try.

21:47.573 --> 21:49.018
Oh, my God.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.016
This is gonna hurt.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.022
Kate, get the hell up here!

22:03.556 --> 22:05.324
No. I'm not leaving without him.

22:05.424 --> 22:06.993
For God's sake, he's a dead man. Move.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.428
God.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.329
There's no time left. Let's go.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.202
Oh, my God. There's got to be a way.

22:16.302 --> 22:18.407
Get the... get the hell out of there.

22:20.139 --> 22:22.909
- Oh, my God.
- Leave him, he's dead.

22:24.626 --> 22:26.295
Oh, my God.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.980
Let me go.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.688
Let me go.

22:48.935 --> 22:49.970
It's still coming. Come on.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.125
So what the hell happened back there?

24:09.248 --> 24:10.226
I don't know.

24:12.785 --> 24:13.986
Hello.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.988
And where did you come from?

24:16.088 --> 24:17.590
What's your name?

24:20.059 --> 24:23.062
I'm... I'm Kate.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.131
Don't you remember me?

24:25.231 --> 24:26.904
I'm Mrs. Paley.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.116
The Colonel was our only link
to this place.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.422
Maybe not.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.183
I designed the door panels in here.

24:44.283 --> 24:46.024
The touch sensors.

24:47.553 --> 24:48.454
What?

24:48.554 --> 24:51.330
I was freelancing
for a subcontractor, I...

24:53.292 --> 24:55.995
You didn't think this
was worth mentioning before?

24:56.095 --> 24:57.496
I signed a confidentiality...

24:57.596 --> 25:00.366
Given our current situation,
I'd say it's null and void.

25:00.466 --> 25:01.701
- Jesus Christ!
- The legal...

25:01.801 --> 25:04.103
- What the hell is this place?
- I don't know.

25:04.203 --> 25:06.772
You don't think the guy that makes
the toilets in the space shuttle,

25:06.872 --> 25:08.507
gets to see the plans for the rest of it?

25:08.607 --> 25:10.610
You must have had some
idea what they were building.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.612
It was experimental. It was a prototype.

25:12.712 --> 25:13.613
For what?

25:13.713 --> 25:14.981
- I'm not sure.
- For what?

25:15.081 --> 25:16.282
Leading-edge stuff.

25:16.382 --> 25:18.150
There were rumors...

25:18.250 --> 25:19.518
What kind of rumors, Jerry?

25:19.618 --> 25:20.961
What rumors?

25:23.322 --> 25:24.995
Quantum teleportation.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.159
Pardon?

25:27.259 --> 25:28.499
They were just rumors.

25:31.363 --> 25:34.533
You mean, like... "Beam me up, Scotty"?

25:34.633 --> 25:36.569
Okay.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.904
Now this is getting ridiculous.

25:39.004 --> 25:40.139
What do you know, Jerry?

25:40.239 --> 25:41.140
Nothing.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.808
- You're lying.
- Why would I lie?

25:42.908 --> 25:44.577
Because both you and the Colonel
work for them.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.579
Them? Who the hell are "them" anyway?

25:46.679 --> 25:48.114
What? The government? The mafia?

25:48.214 --> 25:49.420
Aliens?

25:50.750 --> 25:52.696
Oh, my goodness.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.255
It's a tesseract.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.224
Christ, she's losing it.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.065
Isn't it beautiful?

26:01.460 --> 26:03.167
Isn't what beautiful, Mrs. Paley?

26:07.066 --> 26:08.010
Holy shit.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.137
If you look at it
from just the right angle...

26:11.237 --> 26:14.440
What did you call it again, Mrs. Paley?

26:14.540 --> 26:16.475
It's a tesseract, sweetheart.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.781
Tesseract?

26:19.478 --> 26:21.547
Tesseract.

26:21.647 --> 26:23.549
It's... It's a tesseract.

26:23.649 --> 26:25.584
How do you know it's a tesser... act,

26:25.684 --> 26:26.886
or whatever you call it?

26:26.986 --> 26:29.155
Is the second act beginning already?

26:29.255 --> 26:31.257
We should be getting back to our seats.

26:31.357 --> 26:32.391
Excuse me.

26:32.491 --> 26:33.659
Yeah.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.327
Is she for real?

26:36.929 --> 26:38.698
A tesseract, Holy Christ, of course.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.616
A tesseract.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.069
Jerry, you okay?

26:43.169 --> 26:45.504
Yeah, yeah. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.307
It's been staring at us
in the face the whole time.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.077
Maybe you could share
with the rest of the class.

26:51.177 --> 26:52.745
Oh. Of course.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.013
A tesseract...

26:54.113 --> 26:55.748
it's another name for...

26:55.848 --> 26:57.650
a hypercube.

26:57.750 --> 26:58.851
A what?

26:58.951 --> 27:01.487
A hypercube... a four-dimensional cube.

27:01.587 --> 27:02.488
Four dimensions?

27:02.588 --> 27:04.423
All the elements are there.

27:04.523 --> 27:07.493
Rooms repeating.
Rooms folding in on themselves.

27:07.593 --> 27:08.761
Teleportation.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.932
It could all very well add up.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.735
Look. Here. See?

27:15.835 --> 27:19.004
Let's call one dimension, length,

27:19.104 --> 27:22.041
and represent that with a simple line.

27:22.141 --> 27:25.179
Now, two dimensions are length and width,

27:26.378 --> 27:28.247
which can be represented
by a single square.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.982
Now if we extend that square,

27:30.082 --> 27:31.891
one more dimension...

27:33.118 --> 27:35.588
we get... a cube,

27:35.688 --> 27:37.022
which has three dimensions.

27:37.122 --> 27:39.759
Length, width, and depth.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.393
Come on, we've all passed
the eighth grade.

27:41.493 --> 27:42.428
Hush.

27:42.528 --> 27:46.065
Here's the really funky part.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.500
If you take this cube,

27:47.600 --> 27:49.869
and extend it one more dimension,

27:49.969 --> 27:51.676
we get...

27:52.838 --> 27:53.773
A tesseract.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.642
I thought time was considered
to be the fourth dimension.

27:56.742 --> 27:58.310
Sure. That's one idea.

27:58.410 --> 28:01.347
But what if you have
a fourth spatial dimension?

28:01.447 --> 28:03.682
- There's no such thing.
- Why don't you shut up?

28:03.782 --> 28:04.683
Okay. Okay.

28:04.783 --> 28:07.052
Let's just say that
we are in this hyper...

28:07.152 --> 28:08.788
- Cube.
- Cube. Whatever.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.799
Does this diagram show us how to get out?

28:13.158 --> 28:15.261
Well, uh... no.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.730
A hypercube isn't supposed to be real.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.199
It's just a theoretical construct.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.836
Oh. Well that makes me feel better.

28:23.903 --> 28:26.405
Is there a theory on how
we might get out of this...

28:26.505 --> 28:28.041
theoretical construct?

28:29.608 --> 28:30.509
I don't know.

28:30.609 --> 28:32.845
Don't worry, dear.

28:32.945 --> 28:35.255
It's just a matter of time.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.623
That's so much clearer. Thank you.

28:39.685 --> 28:40.653
Great.

28:40.753 --> 28:42.555
Anyway...

28:42.655 --> 28:44.657
here's my theory for what it's worth:

28:46.191 --> 28:48.194
We are all...

28:48.294 --> 28:51.664
unwilling participants... in a game show,

28:51.764 --> 28:54.768
and are being videotaped as we speak.

28:55.834 --> 28:59.738
Although I don't condone forcible
abduction of innocent people,

28:59.838 --> 29:02.741
we can take comfort in the fact
that once the show airs,

29:02.841 --> 29:06.078
we'll be able to parlay this
into lucrative sponsorship deals.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.080
Okay, Max.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.549
And what's the object of this game show?

29:10.649 --> 29:12.993
Hmm... I don't know. To get out alive?

29:15.487 --> 29:17.125
I think we should make a map.

29:18.190 --> 29:21.360
I don't think a map
is really going to help us.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.133
Look at that.

29:24.229 --> 29:25.902
That wasn't there a minute ago.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.103
Did you write that?

29:31.203 --> 29:33.873
No. I left my wings at home.

29:33.973 --> 29:36.876
I just marked this room as 10 before it.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.078
Somebody's been here before us.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.146
Thanks. A really large someone.

29:41.246 --> 29:43.716
Why go through the trouble
of writing it on the ceiling?

29:43.816 --> 29:47.186
60,659 rooms?

29:47.286 --> 29:48.420
Christ.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.122
This place must be huge.

29:50.222 --> 29:51.757
Oh, yes, yes.

29:51.857 --> 29:55.160
In a hypercube, there could be
60 million rooms.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.329
She could be right.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.568
There's a comforting thought.

30:03.502 --> 30:04.446
What the hell are you doing?

30:05.904 --> 30:07.139
Yowza.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.675
The ratings on this show just doubled.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.043
What do you see?

30:11.143 --> 30:12.578
A girl.

30:12.678 --> 30:13.946
Oh, Jesus.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.616
I'm going in.

30:16.915 --> 30:19.618
- I think I'm going to puke.
- You all right?

30:19.718 --> 30:21.186
Okay. I just... whoa...

30:21.286 --> 30:22.421
Hey. Hey. Hey.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.723
- Get back here.
- What's happening?

30:24.823 --> 30:27.026
- What's going on?
- Help!

30:27.126 --> 30:28.560
Try to give me your hand.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.663
- Help me!
- You okay?

30:30.763 --> 30:32.106
What the hell is going on in there?

30:33.165 --> 30:35.334
Max, don't be an idiot.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.603
- Come on back.
- No, it's okay.

30:37.703 --> 30:39.738
- The gravity shifted.
- She needs help,

30:39.838 --> 30:40.942
- she may be hurt.
- Wow.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.722
Are we going in there or what?

30:56.822 --> 30:58.590
Maybe she knows something.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.426
What about our...

31:00.526 --> 31:02.506
less agile members?

31:04.263 --> 31:05.571
I have an idea.

31:10.869 --> 31:11.813
Hello.

31:13.272 --> 31:14.173
Whoa.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.975
I'm all right.

31:16.075 --> 31:17.452
Miss?

31:22.781 --> 31:24.383
Hey, Miss.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.552
Hey.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.587
Wake up.

31:28.687 --> 31:29.888
She's on her way.

31:29.988 --> 31:32.332
I guess it's time for plan B.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.535
Give her mouth-to-mouth
and see if it works.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.137
Think I should?

31:46.205 --> 31:47.309
Oh, very funny.

31:51.276 --> 31:52.211
Hi.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.879
What's wrong?

31:53.979 --> 31:55.547
What the hell?

31:55.647 --> 31:57.082
Where am I?

31:57.182 --> 31:59.219
That's the million dollar question.

32:05.390 --> 32:06.959
Does she have to keep cackling like that?

32:07.059 --> 32:08.694
Come on, let's get this over with.

32:08.794 --> 32:11.536
All right. This is going
to be some kind of...

32:12.898 --> 32:15.936
Yeah, Mrs. Paley.
Just keep laughing there.

32:18.804 --> 32:21.673
This is more fun than I've had since

32:21.773 --> 32:24.109
my thirteenth birthday.

32:24.209 --> 32:26.812
Glad somebody is having fun.

32:26.912 --> 32:28.914
This reminds me of that rope swing

32:29.014 --> 32:30.816
we used to have at home.

32:30.916 --> 32:33.452
For God's sake, Mrs. Paley,
this isn't a game!

32:33.552 --> 32:35.254
Come on. Come on down.

32:35.354 --> 32:36.789
Simon, you guys, keep her steady.

32:36.889 --> 32:38.368
All right, all right. Come on.

32:39.491 --> 32:42.028
Okay. And you're down. That's good.

32:43.228 --> 32:44.329
It's okay. She's down.

32:44.429 --> 32:45.664
- We've landed.
- Yeah.

32:45.764 --> 32:48.267
It's your turn, you'll have
to climb around the sides.

32:48.367 --> 32:51.036
Well, this is a lot
like the other ones, isn't it?

32:51.136 --> 32:53.572
Christ. This is going to be fun.

32:53.672 --> 32:56.108
Hello there. I'm Mrs. Paley.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.552
Who the hell are you people?

32:59.645 --> 33:00.779
Well...

33:00.879 --> 33:03.792
I'm Kate, and this is Mrs. Paley.

33:04.917 --> 33:06.624
And I am Julia.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.555
And this is...

33:09.655 --> 33:12.397
Hey. Is this your jacket?

33:13.859 --> 33:14.860
No.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.361
Well then how did I...

33:16.461 --> 33:19.704
I must have had more
to drink last night than I thought.

33:24.369 --> 33:25.609
There's nothing in here.

33:26.805 --> 33:28.707
How the hell did I get here?

33:28.807 --> 33:30.480
Have we been kidnapped?

33:33.111 --> 33:34.886
That's a really good question.

33:48.493 --> 33:51.269
Does anyone remember how we got here?

33:53.465 --> 33:55.400
Last thing I remember was going to sleep.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.735
Where?

33:56.835 --> 33:58.637
In my bed.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.739
Where do you live?

34:00.839 --> 34:03.408
Lincoln, Nebraska.

34:03.508 --> 34:07.246
Kate, I am a healthy, married,
male white engineer,

34:07.346 --> 34:10.315
who enjoys reading horror novels
and eating chocolate ice cream,

34:10.415 --> 34:13.396
as well as climbing around
psycho-jungle-gyms.

34:16.321 --> 34:17.857
Okay.

34:19.057 --> 34:22.928
I remember driving home
from Maine State Hospital.

34:23.028 --> 34:25.898
It was late,
and I just wanted to get home,

34:25.998 --> 34:29.001
I've been working long hours.
I'm a psychotherapist.

34:29.101 --> 34:30.705
Simon.

34:32.371 --> 34:33.372
New Haven.

34:33.472 --> 34:35.340
I was out for a drink.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.942
What do you do?

34:40.245 --> 34:41.914
A consultant.

34:42.014 --> 34:44.016
Management consultant.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.784
Yeah, right.

34:45.884 --> 34:47.953
And I'm Santa Claus.

34:48.053 --> 34:51.193
Okay, Max. How about you?

34:53.125 --> 34:56.834
I live in Palo Alto.
I design computer games.

34:57.896 --> 35:00.968
The last thing I remember,
I fell asleep on my keyboard.

35:03.669 --> 35:04.636
Sasha.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.171
And where do you live?

35:06.271 --> 35:08.308
New Mexico.

35:10.208 --> 35:13.579
I was doing my homework
in the kitchen, like I always do.

35:13.679 --> 35:16.182
Nothing ever happens to me.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.256
The last thing I remember...

35:21.386 --> 35:24.595
is taking the dog for a walk.

35:27.092 --> 35:28.660
Julia?

35:28.760 --> 35:32.030
I was at an after party
for a premiere in Santa Monica.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.966
Are you an actress?

35:34.066 --> 35:36.101
No.

35:36.201 --> 35:38.537
No, I'm an attorney.

35:38.637 --> 35:42.380
Let's just say if I was kidnapped
it was for the ransom.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.912
So we've got Silicon Valley,
Connecticut, Nebraska,

35:47.012 --> 35:48.548
Hollywood, Maine.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.584
Mrs. Paley, where exactly do you live?

35:52.684 --> 35:56.355
In that high-rise at the corner
of Riverside and 94th.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.557
Could you give me a lift home, dear?

35:58.657 --> 36:01.493
I seem to have lost my daughter-in-law.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.061
Ignorance is bliss.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.163
This doesn't make any sense.

36:05.263 --> 36:07.499
Yeah, well...

36:07.599 --> 36:09.668
I think they probably flew us here.

36:09.768 --> 36:13.438
Drugged us and flew us out here
in private or military jets.

36:13.538 --> 36:15.274
That's what I think.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.542
- Where is here?
- I don't know.

36:17.642 --> 36:19.945
Your guess is as good as mine.

36:20.045 --> 36:23.515
They could have built
an hypercube structure anywhere.

36:23.615 --> 36:26.551
And if this thing really does fold space,

36:26.651 --> 36:28.787
we could be literately anywhere.

36:28.887 --> 36:29.855
What the hell...

36:29.955 --> 36:31.523
What?

36:31.623 --> 36:33.792
Here is that number again.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.661
6-0-6-5-9

36:35.761 --> 36:38.397
This can't be the same room. Jesus!

36:38.497 --> 36:41.833
It's not, because now they're
in a string of other numbers.

36:41.933 --> 36:44.277
There just can't be that many rooms.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.839
Maybe they are not room numbers.

36:47.939 --> 36:50.818
Maybe somebody else figured something out.

36:56.681 --> 37:00.185
We are definitely not alone.

37:00.285 --> 37:01.593
Check this out.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.189
What is it?

37:04.289 --> 37:05.223
What's happening?

37:05.323 --> 37:06.734
Julia, is that your watch?

37:08.260 --> 37:10.095
No.

37:10.195 --> 37:12.097
No, it's mine.

37:12.197 --> 37:14.433
It...

37:14.533 --> 37:16.368
Well, this is bizarre.

37:16.468 --> 37:19.071
What, somebody else uses
a watch just like yours?

37:19.171 --> 37:21.506
Somebody is playing games with us.

37:21.606 --> 37:24.176
Shit... look...

37:24.276 --> 37:28.347
this is the watch that my wife
gave me on my 40th.

37:28.447 --> 37:29.517
See?

37:30.916 --> 37:33.396
This is the watch we've just found.

37:38.590 --> 37:41.293
Maybe it's your game
that we are playing, Jerry.

37:41.393 --> 37:43.929
You designed the doors,
your watch. What's next?

37:44.029 --> 37:46.031
- No, I...
- For the love of God, Mrs. Paley...

37:46.131 --> 37:47.532
Mrs. Paley, please don't.

37:47.632 --> 37:50.135
Oh, my goodness, I think he's still alive.

37:50.235 --> 37:52.337
- Mrs. Paley, please.
- Get her down.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.638
Easy, careful.

37:53.738 --> 37:55.607
Is somebody in there?

37:55.707 --> 37:57.008
- What do you see?
- Jerry?

37:57.108 --> 37:59.644
Oh, God. There's a guy down here.

37:59.744 --> 38:00.712
Oh!

38:00.812 --> 38:03.048
- The gravity's shifting.
- What's happening?

38:03.148 --> 38:04.416
You okay? Are you all right?

38:04.516 --> 38:06.151
Simon, what's going on?

38:06.251 --> 38:07.285
My God.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.888
Hey, hey, fellow.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.490
Oh, Jesus.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.091
- Be careful.
- Ugh!

38:13.191 --> 38:16.194
- Is he alive?
- I don't think so.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.296
- Let's roll him over.
- Yeah, yeah...

38:19.698 --> 38:22.474
Oh, God, is he ripe.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.937
What... what is that?

38:26.037 --> 38:29.040
Oh! It looks pretty dead to me.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.342
I hope he's still alive.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.577
He's been here for a while, Mrs. Paley.

38:32.677 --> 38:34.880
Oh, poor man.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.615
Who do you think wrote these numbers?

38:36.715 --> 38:39.885
He must have written them himself,
It's all upside down.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.554
It's the same writing
as those numbers we keep seeing.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.523
Oh, no!

38:44.623 --> 38:47.159
It's poor Dr. Rosenzweig.

38:47.259 --> 38:49.127
You know him?

38:49.227 --> 38:52.931
He'll never get his Nobel Prize now.

38:53.031 --> 38:56.034
- Who the hell is he?
- Holy Christ...

38:56.134 --> 38:58.336
Phil Rosenzweig.

38:58.436 --> 39:01.540
Last year he was the leading
theoretical physicist in his field.

39:01.640 --> 39:04.543
- Which was?
- Quantum chaos.

39:04.643 --> 39:08.279
Oh, God, Phil Rosenzweig.
I read his book...

39:15.554 --> 39:17.789
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.459
Is he...?

39:23.328 --> 39:24.363
Kate, is he...?

39:32.571 --> 39:34.906
- Yeah, he's gone.
- You are positive?

39:35.006 --> 39:36.541
Uh-huh.

39:36.641 --> 39:38.376
Somebody...?

39:38.476 --> 39:40.312
I'm here, Sasha. Got you.

39:40.412 --> 39:42.314
Does anyone understand these numbers?

39:42.414 --> 39:43.615
What was he writing?

39:43.715 --> 39:44.983
Beats me.

39:45.083 --> 39:48.428
May be he was trying to calculate
his way out of here.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.890
Looks like he ran out of time.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.693
How did old Mrs. Paley know him?

39:54.793 --> 39:57.762
- I don't know.
- Hey, look. More numbers.

39:57.862 --> 39:59.664
Same handwriting.

39:59.764 --> 40:02.601
The question is,
did he solve it before he died?

40:03.835 --> 40:06.372
God. She's okay. Are you okay?

40:06.671 --> 40:08.073
He must have finished it here.

40:08.173 --> 40:10.375
Look, there it is again... 6-0-6-5-9.

40:10.475 --> 40:12.410
How does that get us out of here?

40:12.510 --> 40:14.946
- It's got to mean something.
- Yeah, but what?

40:15.046 --> 40:17.682
I don't know, but we better remember it.

40:17.782 --> 40:22.087
You know, I wonder if is he's got a...

40:22.187 --> 40:25.600
What are you doing? That's disgusting.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.761
Found a pen.

40:29.861 --> 40:32.197
Hope you have better luck than he did.

40:32.297 --> 40:34.332
Oh, no, this can't be happening.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.700
Oh, dear.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.169
Oh, dear, just wait.

40:38.269 --> 40:41.139
Oh, I'm such an idiot.
Oh, no. Wait a minute.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.208
She's gonna drive me insane.

40:43.308 --> 40:46.511
Oh, it was right here.

40:46.611 --> 40:49.080
- What is it, Mrs. Paley?
- Izon, where are you?

40:49.180 --> 40:51.483
I'm such an idiot.

40:51.583 --> 40:55.287
- Did she say Izon?
- Izon, where are you?

40:55.387 --> 40:57.188
You come back here this instant.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.591
Who are you looking for Mrs. Paley?

40:59.691 --> 41:02.060
Have you seen my dog?

41:02.160 --> 41:05.397
He's a darling little Shi-Tzu. Darn it.

41:08.466 --> 41:12.003
Her dog's name is "Izon"? That's weird.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.505
I thought Izon was a...

41:13.605 --> 41:15.173
A weapons manufacturer.

41:15.273 --> 41:16.842
Yes.

41:20.078 --> 41:24.083
And you guys would know that because...

41:27.218 --> 41:29.459
I read the papers.

41:30.789 --> 41:33.825
- Mrs. Paley...
- Poor puppy...

41:33.925 --> 41:37.362
Mrs. Paley, are you sure
you didn't leave the dog at home?

41:37.462 --> 41:40.966
No. He was right here. I'm such an idiot.

41:41.066 --> 41:43.535
This breaks my heart.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.870
Mrs. Paley...

41:45.970 --> 41:48.273
Mrs. Paley, what do you do for living?

41:48.373 --> 41:50.475
Oh, nothing. I'm retired.

41:50.575 --> 41:52.744
I shouldn't have let him off the leash.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.547
Before you retired, what did you do?

41:55.647 --> 41:58.719
Nothing very exciting.
I was a theoretical mathematician.

42:01.686 --> 42:03.655
Where did you work?

42:03.755 --> 42:05.757
Oh, my head hurts.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.860
At Skippy Research Affiliates...

42:08.960 --> 42:12.831
what do they called it?
A think-tank in Washington state.

42:12.931 --> 42:16.001
She worked for Skippy Research Affiliates

42:16.101 --> 42:17.969
and her dog's name was Izon?

42:18.069 --> 42:20.205
- Mrs. Paley?
- Hmm?

42:20.305 --> 42:25.010
Is it possible that you worked
for Izon Research Affiliates

42:25.110 --> 42:27.317
and your dog's name is Skippy?

42:28.379 --> 42:30.757
How did you know where I worked?

42:31.950 --> 42:34.419
Oh, God.

42:34.519 --> 42:36.388
She worked for a weapons manufacturer?

42:36.488 --> 42:39.224
She's a good friend of our Nobel wanna-be.

42:39.324 --> 42:43.101
I don't think we should trust
Mrs. Funnyfarm.

42:44.162 --> 42:47.609
I'm not crazy, and I'm not
hard of hearing either.

42:49.134 --> 42:51.469
I told you no one would believe me.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.805
Mrs. Paley,

42:53.905 --> 42:56.274
what sort of research did you do at Izon?

42:56.374 --> 42:58.610
General, I will not be party
to this insanity!

42:58.710 --> 42:59.944
I'm not a general.

43:00.044 --> 43:02.113
I don't care what Alex Trusk says.

43:02.213 --> 43:05.016
It's impossible.
And what's more, it's inhuman.

43:05.116 --> 43:07.118
- Who's Alex?
- Did she say Alex Trusk?

43:07.218 --> 43:10.388
Oh, Christ. We're dead.

43:10.488 --> 43:12.257
This is really getting ridiculous.

43:12.357 --> 43:13.858
Who's Alex Trusk?

43:13.958 --> 43:17.429
Alex Trusk? Hacker extraordinare?
He's a legend.

43:17.529 --> 43:20.865
This is exactly the kind
of twisted maze he'd create.

43:20.965 --> 43:23.104
Alex Trusk doesn't even exist.

43:24.169 --> 43:26.571
Some things should never be created.

43:26.671 --> 43:29.541
They exist for theoretical purposes only.

43:29.641 --> 43:33.978
It would never last.
Can't you understand that?

43:34.078 --> 43:36.347
Okay, you're a shrink.

43:36.447 --> 43:40.919
Can you tell me what the hell's happening?

43:41.019 --> 43:42.387
I... umm...

43:42.487 --> 43:44.923
I'd say that seeing the dead man

43:45.023 --> 43:46.891
triggered some sort of emotional response.

43:46.991 --> 43:49.494
Flashbacks, post-traumatic stress...

43:49.594 --> 43:52.464
So she is connected to this, yeah?

43:52.564 --> 43:54.165
Skippy...

43:54.265 --> 43:58.336
Ooh, I think I hear him.

43:58.436 --> 43:59.804
Skippy?

43:59.904 --> 44:02.040
Mrs. Paley, Mrs. Paley, don't...

44:02.140 --> 44:03.341
Skippy?

44:03.441 --> 44:05.043
Mrs. Paley.

44:09.247 --> 44:11.284
Oh, my.

44:19.257 --> 44:22.293
Help me, please.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.565
No, don't trust the old cunt.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.435
She's lying about everything.

44:34.205 --> 44:36.840
What the... Jesus fucking Christ.

44:37.442 --> 44:40.480
What just happened?

44:41.246 --> 44:43.047
It took my head, man.

44:43.147 --> 44:44.482
I lost my fucking head!

44:44.582 --> 44:47.285
Paley opened...

44:47.385 --> 44:49.454
the portal...

44:57.962 --> 45:00.498
Wait, wait, I have an idea.

45:00.598 --> 45:04.235
I think we're all tired.
We need to calm down, everybody.

45:04.335 --> 45:07.572
Hold it. Wait a minute!

45:07.672 --> 45:09.140
I have an idea.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.876
Let me guess, you designed the floor too.

45:11.976 --> 45:14.245
You better have a really
good fucking explanation, Jerry.

45:14.345 --> 45:16.848
I know what just
happened there was a little...

45:16.948 --> 45:21.252
shocking, but it actually
makes total sense if we're...

45:21.352 --> 45:23.755
in a really multi-dimensional
quantum environment.

45:23.855 --> 45:25.356
English, please.

45:25.456 --> 45:29.294
One fundamental idea
of a quantum universe,

45:29.394 --> 45:33.264
is that parallel realities
can actually exist simultaneously.

45:33.364 --> 45:34.532
How do you know that, Jerry?

45:34.632 --> 45:36.668
All you designed were the door panels!

45:36.768 --> 45:38.336
I read it in Rosenzweig book,

45:38.436 --> 45:40.305
it was a big part of this theory.

45:40.405 --> 45:43.341
What if whoever designed
this stinking thing

45:43.441 --> 45:46.511
somehow managed to create
a place where parallel realities

45:46.611 --> 45:48.646
can crossover like that?

45:48.746 --> 45:51.716
So you are saying
we just saw Simon and Mrs. Paley

45:51.816 --> 45:53.685
- in a parallel universe?
- Yes, yes!

45:53.785 --> 45:54.986
Stop it!

45:55.086 --> 45:57.522
A universe where things
turn out a little differently.

45:57.622 --> 45:59.324
- Fuck.
- Uh, please.

45:59.424 --> 46:01.259
Think about it, think about it.

46:01.359 --> 46:03.228
A few minutes before,

46:03.328 --> 46:05.029
- when you found the watch...
- Yeah.

46:05.129 --> 46:06.931
...and we realized that somebody else

46:07.031 --> 46:09.133
had been marking numbers
in the rooms, right?

46:09.233 --> 46:12.070
That's when I thought maybe
we should leave markers behind,

46:12.170 --> 46:14.439
in case we doubled back
and got side-tracked.

46:14.539 --> 46:16.741
Things like a piece of clothing
or jewelry.

46:16.841 --> 46:20.178
I think what a pity it would be
to leave my watch.

46:20.278 --> 46:22.447
But I would do it if I had to.

46:22.547 --> 46:25.216
You're saying that in an alternate reality

46:25.316 --> 46:27.085
we'd already gotten ourselves
into such trouble

46:27.185 --> 46:29.120
that you decided that is okay
to leave your watch?

46:29.220 --> 46:30.922
- Yes!
- For crying out loud!

46:31.022 --> 46:32.092
What a load of crap!

46:32.623 --> 46:34.559
There's got to be a logical explanation.

46:34.659 --> 46:36.394
What would you think that is?

46:36.494 --> 46:39.297
This is just an optical illusion
or something?

46:39.397 --> 46:40.899
Yeah, sure. Why not?

46:40.999 --> 46:43.268
Finally, yeah. A sane idea.

46:43.368 --> 46:44.969
Oh, that's a sane idea.

46:45.069 --> 46:45.970
All right.

46:46.070 --> 46:49.140
If Max is right, why don't you
go and open that door?

46:49.240 --> 46:51.009
- Oh, come on.
- Have a look.

46:51.109 --> 46:52.076
Excuse me?

46:52.176 --> 46:54.112
If you're so sure
it's an optical illusion,

46:54.212 --> 46:56.158
open the door and have a look.

47:06.991 --> 47:09.894
You might want to stand
to the side, in case that thing...

47:09.994 --> 47:11.598
Fuck off, Jerry!

47:20.304 --> 47:21.248
Okay, hold it!

47:23.441 --> 47:25.512
All right? Don't open it.

47:27.478 --> 47:29.614
Say Jerry's right,

47:29.714 --> 47:32.684
I think all of this is a hoax, okay?

47:32.784 --> 47:35.753
I think Jerry's either full
of shit or part of this experiment.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.989
- Simon, I never...
- Shut the fuck up!

47:38.089 --> 47:39.891
I'm agreeing with you, Max.

47:39.991 --> 47:44.128
I think we're all pumped so full of LSD

47:44.228 --> 47:46.597
and I think we're hidden
in some CIA hospital

47:46.697 --> 47:48.366
in Area 51, or whatever.

47:48.466 --> 47:50.134
But let's just say, on the off-chance

47:50.234 --> 47:53.638
that Jerry is actually right.

47:53.738 --> 47:56.741
Then what happens if whatever
the fuck it was in there

47:56.841 --> 48:00.578
that killed the guy, killed me, what happens
if that fucking thing gets in here?

48:00.678 --> 48:02.521
What happens then?

48:03.581 --> 48:05.383
You're all crazy.

48:07.151 --> 48:08.686
Hey, man, what are you doing?

48:08.786 --> 48:10.888
Just don't fucking open the door.

48:10.988 --> 48:13.057
What are you so scared of anyway?

48:13.157 --> 48:16.260
I just saw my fucking head
taken off by something or other.

48:16.360 --> 48:17.528
How's that for starters?

48:17.628 --> 48:19.471
Where did you get that knife?

48:21.732 --> 48:23.336
It's mine.

48:24.869 --> 48:26.237
I collect knives.

48:26.337 --> 48:28.740
He had it when I first saw him.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.675
- He sure did.
- That's convenient.

48:30.775 --> 48:32.577
He's the only guy with a knife here,

48:32.677 --> 48:35.246
if anyone was a part
of the experiment... maybe you.

48:35.346 --> 48:38.516
I know! I know! I've got it! I've got it!

48:39.851 --> 48:41.486
Why don't we all just

48:41.586 --> 48:43.087
get some ice cream

48:43.187 --> 48:46.361
and everyone will feel
a lot better about everything?

48:50.528 --> 48:53.664
You're funny, Mrs. Paley.
You really are a funny old lady.

48:53.764 --> 48:55.933
You're also cute and senile.

48:56.033 --> 48:58.269
You leave her alone,
she doesn't understand.

48:58.369 --> 49:01.339
All right, she's already admitted
working for Izon,

49:01.439 --> 49:04.308
one of the most powerful weapons
manufacturers in the world.

49:04.408 --> 49:06.644
She recognized the figures on the wall,

49:06.744 --> 49:08.146
and she knew the dead guy.

49:08.246 --> 49:11.449
No. Maybe my alter ego
wasn't all that wrong.

49:11.549 --> 49:14.952
Maybe we shouldn't trust
dear old Mrs. Paley.

49:15.052 --> 49:17.722
Maybe you're the one we shouldn't trust.

49:17.822 --> 49:19.927
I beg your pardon?

49:21.859 --> 49:25.329
Maybe you're the one we shouldn't trust.

49:25.429 --> 49:27.331
Oh.

49:27.431 --> 49:29.700
I'm going to ignore that, little girl,

49:29.800 --> 49:31.609
because you're a cripple.

49:37.909 --> 49:40.617
I think we should keep moving, huh?

49:42.547 --> 49:44.151
After you.

50:05.770 --> 50:08.406
Kate, I'm really thirsty.

50:08.506 --> 50:11.578
Me too, sweetheart. Me too.

50:15.813 --> 50:18.293
I'm exhausted. Are we there yet?

50:19.350 --> 50:22.263
Come on, Mrs. Paley.
Just hold on a little longer.

50:40.805 --> 50:43.574
Who's this Alex Trusk person?

50:43.674 --> 50:45.109
Are you kidding?

50:45.209 --> 50:47.445
He programmed the virus that crashed

50:47.545 --> 50:50.181
the Tokyo stock exchange two years ago.

50:50.281 --> 50:54.051
He's the one that broke into
the Air Traffic Control Grid,

50:54.151 --> 50:56.521
and crashed those two
Air Force jets in Nevada

50:56.621 --> 50:58.723
to protest military spending.

50:58.823 --> 51:00.925
You forgot the one about Alex Trusk

51:01.025 --> 51:03.594
being the first genetically
engineered superhuman,

51:03.694 --> 51:07.031
bred in a test tube, who now
lives and walks amongst us.

51:07.131 --> 51:09.634
That sounds a bit far-fetched.

51:09.734 --> 51:11.002
Don't worry.

51:11.102 --> 51:14.572
Alex Trusk is a conspiracy
theorist's wet dream.

51:14.672 --> 51:16.140
He doesn't exist.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.843
Fine. Just keep fooling yourself.

51:18.943 --> 51:22.152
Would you people
just shut up and keep moving?

51:26.183 --> 51:28.352
Do you really believe this stuff

51:28.452 --> 51:30.688
about parallel universes?

51:30.788 --> 51:33.391
If you asked me yesterday, I'd say no.

51:33.491 --> 51:37.098
But this place changes your
perception about what's possible.

52:41.459 --> 52:44.495
Look, let's just keep this
between us for now.

52:44.595 --> 52:46.597
Yeah. Okay.

52:48.899 --> 52:51.435
Here's the deal.
I'm a private investigator.

52:51.535 --> 52:54.141
I'm on a case, missing persons.

52:55.840 --> 52:59.343
Given our current situation,
this counts as irony.

52:59.443 --> 53:01.412
You're right.

53:01.512 --> 53:04.548
I think they stuck me in here
because of her...

53:04.648 --> 53:06.617
Becky Young.

53:06.717 --> 53:11.255
They've emptied my pockets
except for my knife and this.

53:11.355 --> 53:13.357
Maybe it's a message or a warning.

53:16.494 --> 53:18.396
Here's the kicker.

53:18.496 --> 53:20.874
Guess who she worked for?

53:26.103 --> 53:27.207
Izon?

53:32.610 --> 53:33.554
Kate.

53:36.580 --> 53:37.524
Kate.

53:39.483 --> 53:41.018
Kate, you have to wake up, there's...

53:41.118 --> 53:42.820
What is it? What's wrong?

53:42.920 --> 53:45.089
There's something here.

53:45.189 --> 53:47.625
Do you see anything?

53:47.725 --> 53:50.968
You're probably just dreaming or some...

53:52.530 --> 53:53.600
Whoa.

53:55.533 --> 53:56.901
There is...

53:57.001 --> 53:58.869
there is something.

53:58.969 --> 54:00.915
What the hell is that?

54:04.341 --> 54:05.319
Kate.

54:07.511 --> 54:09.413
Kate, what do you see?

54:09.513 --> 54:12.650
It's a square. It's just floating.

54:12.750 --> 54:14.385
What is it?

54:14.485 --> 54:16.020
It's beautiful.

54:16.120 --> 54:18.055
You recognize this too, Mrs. Paley?

54:18.155 --> 54:20.091
Well, not exactly...

54:20.191 --> 54:22.026
- What just happened?
- Now there's two.

54:22.126 --> 54:23.160
It's multiplying.

54:23.260 --> 54:25.930
- Oh, my God...
- Maybe it's the way out.

54:26.030 --> 54:27.732
Oh. Wow.

54:27.832 --> 54:30.401
If we're drunk,
I wanna know what this stuff is.

54:30.501 --> 54:33.337
Maybe that's what a
four-dimensional object looks like.

54:33.437 --> 54:36.316
If that's the way out, how do we use it?

54:38.409 --> 54:41.515
I hate it. It sounds wrong.

54:44.381 --> 54:45.716
It's stunning.

54:45.816 --> 54:47.752
The math of it.

54:47.852 --> 54:51.856
It's a perfect quadrangular oscillation.

54:51.956 --> 54:54.958
It's moving. Mrs. Paley, no!

54:56.460 --> 54:57.803
Ahh.

54:59.730 --> 55:02.142
Get the fuck out of the way!

55:03.934 --> 55:05.336
Jerry, you're hurt.

55:05.436 --> 55:07.004
No. I'm okay.

55:07.104 --> 55:08.048
Look out.

55:11.208 --> 55:12.744
Stay low.

55:14.778 --> 55:16.447
Whoa! Go on.

55:16.547 --> 55:18.584
Come on, Mrs. Paley. It's time to go.

55:23.120 --> 55:24.895
Over here. It looks safe.

55:31.829 --> 55:34.537
- Don't stare at it. Go.
- It's coming back.

55:35.866 --> 55:36.801
Come on, Max.

55:36.901 --> 55:38.402
Go, Julia. Go.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.846
- I want to get it.
- No. We've got to go.

55:44.842 --> 55:47.413
Oh, my God. Go. Go up the stairs.

55:49.713 --> 55:51.488
Come on, Mrs. Paley. Keep going...

55:54.518 --> 55:55.886
Kate!

55:55.986 --> 55:56.887
Sasha.

56:00.858 --> 56:01.859
Jerry.

56:01.959 --> 56:03.563
- Oh, Jesus!
- No.

56:08.766 --> 56:11.202
- Sasha.
- No. Just don't do it.

56:11.302 --> 56:13.337
- Just get in here.
- What the fuck are you doing?

56:13.437 --> 56:14.405
Kate!

56:14.505 --> 56:17.111
She's gone. You want to end up like Jerry?

56:19.443 --> 56:21.218
- Sasha.
- Kate!

56:21.478 --> 56:23.481
Kate, I'm here.

56:23.581 --> 56:24.482
Kate.

56:24.582 --> 56:26.391
You're a dead woman.

56:29.587 --> 56:31.726
Oh... oh, Jesus.

56:35.025 --> 56:36.231
Sasha.

56:37.995 --> 56:39.565
Kate, help.

56:42.866 --> 56:45.236
- Kate, help!
- I'm coming to get you.

56:45.336 --> 56:46.370
Help me!

56:46.470 --> 56:48.279
Drop to the ground, Sasha. Now.

56:50.207 --> 56:51.618
Help me.

56:54.345 --> 56:56.188
Okay, Sasha.

56:57.281 --> 57:00.284
Now... uh... I can see you, Sasha.

57:00.384 --> 57:03.220
Flatten yourself
against the wall, on the ground.

57:03.320 --> 57:05.823
- Crawl towards me.
- No. I can't. I'm scared.

57:05.923 --> 57:08.492
You've gotta move,
or I can't come and get you.

57:08.592 --> 57:10.661
Move towards me.

57:10.761 --> 57:12.329
No. Stop, Sasha!

57:12.429 --> 57:14.265
Don't, Sasha.

57:14.365 --> 57:15.309
Get down.

57:16.367 --> 57:18.502
Damn it, Kate, what do you want me to do?

57:18.602 --> 57:21.672
Just keep moving until
you hit that corner,

57:21.772 --> 57:23.007
and then stay put.

57:23.107 --> 57:24.882
Okay?

57:26.377 --> 57:28.312
Sasha?

57:28.412 --> 57:31.359
Okay? I'm almost there.

57:33.450 --> 57:36.387
Just crawl on. Keep your side
to the ground. You can do it.

57:36.487 --> 57:38.489
You've made it. I'm right behind you.

57:38.589 --> 57:40.758
There you are. Keep your knees in.

57:40.858 --> 57:43.327
Kate, thank God.

57:43.427 --> 57:46.237
There you are. You're okay. You're okay...

58:06.450 --> 58:08.152
What just happened?

58:08.252 --> 58:10.154
I don't know.

58:10.254 --> 58:12.165
I don't know, Sasha.

58:29.239 --> 58:31.141
Sweet Jesus.

58:31.241 --> 58:34.311
It's shrinking so it can get us.

58:34.411 --> 58:36.080
Please let it be quick.

58:36.180 --> 58:37.247
Okay.

58:37.347 --> 58:39.416
We're going to make a run for it.

58:39.516 --> 58:41.885
- I can't.
- Yes you can. Just hold onto me.

58:41.985 --> 58:43.821
We're going to go to our right.

58:43.921 --> 58:46.090
No. We're going to go to the left.

58:46.190 --> 58:47.591
All right?

58:47.691 --> 58:49.126
- Okay?
- Okay.

58:49.226 --> 58:51.706
On the count of three...
just hold on to me.

58:54.164 --> 58:57.434
One, two, three...

58:57.534 --> 58:59.370
I've got you.

58:59.470 --> 59:00.671
Oh, my God!

59:00.771 --> 59:01.749
Sasha, no.

59:33.303 --> 59:35.673
It responds to our movements.

59:35.773 --> 59:37.753
Don't move.

59:39.877 --> 59:41.879
Stay still.

59:41.979 --> 59:43.458
Don't...

59:55.425 --> 59:56.460
Oh, my God.

59:56.560 --> 59:58.629
Is it gone?

59:58.729 --> 01:00:00.664
Yeah. It's gone.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:01.970
Thank you.

01:00:03.167 --> 01:00:06.070
We did it together. Let's get out
of here before it comes back.

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:07.137
My glasses.

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:09.673
You're glasses are gone.
Just go up the ladder.

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:12.209
- Kate.
- Yeah? What?

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:14.111
- I can smell it.
- What?

01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:16.113
Did someone die in here?

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:17.783
Yeah.

01:00:19.416 --> 01:00:22.286
- Yeah. Jerry died.
- Oh, no.

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:24.923
He was so nice.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:29.660
We've got to go. We've got to go, honey.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.762
Just get up there.
One foot after the other.

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:34.498
- Where are the others?
- I think we're on our own.

01:00:34.598 --> 01:00:35.975
You're doing good.

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:01.169
I see a pattern.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.438
Anyone connected to this...

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:07.842
this hypercube...

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.568
eventually dies a very violent,

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:13.841
and painful death.

01:01:21.945 --> 01:01:25.916
I would hate for that
to happen to you, Mrs. Paley.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.853
I would.

01:01:29.953 --> 01:01:31.522
So drop the act

01:01:31.622 --> 01:01:34.691
and tell us how we get out of here.

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:36.860
Huh?

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.028
Simon.

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:39.429
Simon, that's enough.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.098
- Shut up.
- Hey, Simon...

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:42.734
- Shut up.
- Okay.

01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:48.974
Okay, Mrs. Paley. You ready to talk?

01:01:51.108 --> 01:01:52.951
'Cause I'm all ears.

01:01:55.512 --> 01:01:58.348
I really don't need
this operation, Doctor.

01:01:58.448 --> 01:01:59.950
I'm in perfect health.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:02.553
Just ask my daughter-in-law
over there. She'll explain.

01:02:02.653 --> 01:02:04.221
This joke's really getting stale.

01:02:04.321 --> 01:02:07.724
I'm going to give you one
more chance, Mrs. Paley.

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.760
You tell me what I need to know,

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.728
or I'm going to have to kill you.

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:14.631
Do you understand? I'm going to kill you.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.433
It's your choice.

01:02:16.533 --> 01:02:18.135
Get away from her!

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:21.038
You have a choice to make. Right now.

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:23.440
Do you want to get out of here or not?

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.642
- Yes, but...
- There are no buts!

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.415
Hey guys, maybe...

01:02:29.046 --> 01:02:30.581
All right.

01:02:31.949 --> 01:02:33.150
Oh, shit.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.818
It's here.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:36.955
It's gonna take my head off.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:40.657
Let's go.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.492
What about Mrs. Paley?

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.661
Goddamn it.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:47.231
- I'm not gonna die here.
- You can't leave her.

01:02:47.331 --> 01:02:50.067
- Why should I help her?
- She'll die.

01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:52.135
- Forget about her.
- I'm gonna regret this.

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:53.470
Julia!

01:02:54.705 --> 01:02:57.674
- I'm trying to get this off.
- Come on. Hurry.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.977
Shit! Would someone give me a hand?

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:01.852
Would somebody help me pick her up?

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.348
Shit!

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:06.083
Let go of me.

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:07.084
Shit!

01:03:07.184 --> 01:03:09.853
I'm not staying here. I'm out of here.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:11.121
Let go of me.

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:12.700
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my God.

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:21.408
Oh, God.

01:03:43.787 --> 01:03:45.455
Where do you think you're going?

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:46.966
Hurry up.

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:52.574
Get back here.

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:09.957
What the hell?

01:04:27.798 --> 01:04:29.709
6-0-6-5-9.

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:33.971
It could mean anything.

01:04:34.071 --> 01:04:35.872
Right.

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:39.443
Maybe it's a coordinate of
some kind but in four dimensions.

01:04:39.543 --> 01:04:40.744
Some...

01:04:40.844 --> 01:04:42.446
I don't know.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.047
For all we know,

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:46.183
it could be somebody's birthday,

01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:47.884
or a zip code,

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:50.362
or just a serial number.

01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:55.302
I wish I was just... smarter.

01:04:59.863 --> 01:05:02.002
Why do you think you're in here?

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:05.702
I don't know.

01:05:05.802 --> 01:05:08.248
Maybe I was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

01:05:09.873 --> 01:05:13.110
Damn it. There's got to be
some sort of meaning to this.

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:17.647
6-0-6-5-9.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:20.990
Maybe they just like to watch us squirm.

01:05:30.994 --> 01:05:35.399
Alex Trusk is the only one
with the resources

01:05:35.499 --> 01:05:38.535
and brains to create something like this.

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:40.637
Okay, Max. Say you're right.

01:05:40.737 --> 01:05:43.907
Say it is Alex Trusk who's
responsible for all of this.

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:46.209
Does it help us get out?

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:49.279
No, we're still stuck here, with no clue.

01:05:49.379 --> 01:05:53.784
And if this is someone's game,
it isn't a fair one.

01:05:53.884 --> 01:05:56.455
Max, do you think...

01:05:58.155 --> 01:06:01.329
We've got to keep moving. Come on.

01:06:03.593 --> 01:06:05.470
Max?

01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:13.170
Max, what's wrong with you?

01:06:28.185 --> 01:06:31.354
Holy shit! Variable time-speed rooms.

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:34.825
- Pretty wild.
- I guess you could say that.

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:57.581
Holy jumping Jesus!

01:06:57.681 --> 01:06:59.483
Get your hands off me.

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:01.384
- Hello, Jerry.
- Who the hell are you?

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:03.053
- You don't recognize me?
- Where am I?

01:07:03.153 --> 01:07:05.522
- How do you know my name?
- You don't know me?

01:07:05.622 --> 01:07:07.390
No. Where the hell am I?

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:08.492
You don't...?

01:07:08.592 --> 01:07:09.593
Wait, wait.

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:12.229
You don't remember me?

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:14.898
- No.
- What about the senile old broad,

01:07:14.998 --> 01:07:17.100
- or the little blind kid?
- What?

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.603
Or that thing that chopped
you up like little pieces

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.538
of deli fucking meat?

01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:24.307
I'm a friend... I mean you no harm.

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:26.877
Let me go, and I'll be on my way.

01:07:26.977 --> 01:07:28.547
No come on, you...

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:33.627
You mean me no harm?
You're fucking hilarious, Jerry.

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:37.120
How long have you been in here?

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.791
I don't know. I just woke up.

01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:42.659
You just woke up?

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:44.728
Holy shit!

01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:46.563
Holy shit.

01:07:46.663 --> 01:07:48.798
Maybe you were right before, huh?

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:51.868
You or the... whatever...

01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:56.373
This place does crossover
parallel alternate realities, huh?

01:07:56.473 --> 01:07:58.749
Have you been drinking?

01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:05.081
I really don't give a shit anymore.

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.889
We are talking about alternate realities.

01:08:12.122 --> 01:08:15.292
Can I ask you a question?

01:08:15.392 --> 01:08:16.893
Do you mind?

01:08:16.993 --> 01:08:19.062
Yeah, okay, sure...

01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:21.369
just don't hurt me, huh?

01:08:24.034 --> 01:08:25.468
Are you hungry?

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:27.605
Are you... hungry?

01:08:31.308 --> 01:08:34.812
Yeah, I guess... my stomach's...

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.983
'Cause I am hungry.

01:08:40.083 --> 01:08:43.121
I'm fucking starving.

01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:24.997
Oh, my God.

01:09:27.597 --> 01:09:29.770
Kate, what is it?

01:09:39.976 --> 01:09:41.344
Kate?

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:43.287
What do you see?

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:54.802
Kate, what's going on?

01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:58.766
I don't know. I mean...

01:10:00.163 --> 01:10:04.305
I think in some other reality,
things didn't turn out so well.

01:10:17.614 --> 01:10:19.749
Again with the Alex Trusk?

01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:22.185
Why are you so afraid of this Alex Trusk?

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:26.356
Because he's ruthless.
He's a hi-tech genius

01:10:26.456 --> 01:10:28.358
whose morals make Muammar Qaddafi

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:30.193
look like Mother Teresa.

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:32.028
Why are you panicking?

01:10:32.128 --> 01:10:36.166
Because he's throwing anybody
connected to this thing in here

01:10:36.266 --> 01:10:38.535
to fucking die!

01:10:38.635 --> 01:10:40.637
Max, you're not connected.

01:10:48.044 --> 01:10:49.955
Can you keep a secret?

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.557
Sure. I love secrets.

01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:58.455
I designed a computer game
called "Relativity,"

01:10:58.555 --> 01:11:02.592
where contestants linked
to each over the Internet

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:05.028
do battle in a 3-D environment,

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:07.540
using different time signatures.

01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:10.633
What are you saying?

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:13.603
Are you saying that you designed all this?

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:15.739
No. Just these variable time speeds rooms.

01:11:15.839 --> 01:11:17.574
Just the concept.

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:20.377
It was for a game. Now here we are.

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:21.378
Wow.

01:11:21.478 --> 01:11:23.380
This is really some game, Max.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.683
Do you have other little secrets
you want to tell me?

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:28.284
People are dead, okay?

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:30.153
I'm not responsible for this.

01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:32.155
It was just a game.

01:11:32.255 --> 01:11:34.324
I can't even sell the stupid thing.

01:11:34.424 --> 01:11:36.693
It's all involved in a lawsuit.

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.728
What kind of lawsuit?

01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:40.430
I don't know, some...

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:42.737
Right, you're a lawyer.

01:11:44.534 --> 01:11:47.538
A company called Cyber Thrill
stole it from me.

01:11:49.072 --> 01:11:50.573
Cyber Thrill?

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:52.942
You've heard of them?

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:54.277
Yeah.

01:11:54.377 --> 01:11:56.357
Are you into computer games?

01:11:57.413 --> 01:12:00.350
Settle.

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:02.185
Excuse me?

01:12:02.285 --> 01:12:06.723
I strongly recommend that
you settle. You'll never win.

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:09.993
- How do you know that?
- Because...

01:12:10.093 --> 01:12:12.362
you're not up against Cyber Thrill.

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:14.531
They're just a subsidiary.

01:12:14.631 --> 01:12:16.766
Who owns them?

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:18.468
Izon.

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:21.171
How do you know that?

01:12:21.271 --> 01:12:23.473
Because I...

01:12:23.573 --> 01:12:25.519
represent them.

01:13:01.311 --> 01:13:03.723
I must be hearing things.

01:13:20.296 --> 01:13:21.197
Finally.

01:13:21.297 --> 01:13:23.800
I was wondering if I was
the only one in here.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.469
Do you need a hand there?

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:28.304
You are upside-down.

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:32.041
Do you have any idea what's going on here?

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.710
Be careful. Watch your step.

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:36.086
Crazy.

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:39.048
You are not the only person here, Jerry.

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:41.985
There's lots of people just like you.

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:44.292
How do you know my name?

01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:48.057
We've met before, Jerry.

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:51.394
I get this mouth-watering feeling
when I talk to you.

01:13:51.494 --> 01:13:54.464
- What do you mean?
- Come here, look at this.

01:13:54.564 --> 01:13:55.665
Hey, hey. Agh!

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:58.968
- Agh, no!
- Take this! And this!

01:14:04.307 --> 01:14:06.743
Why don't you just go?

01:14:06.843 --> 01:14:08.878
I'm blind, Kate.

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:11.014
I'm a burden.

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:14.284
You can move faster without me.

01:14:14.384 --> 01:14:16.719
Sasha, please, I know how you're feeling.

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:19.923
No you don't.
You have no idea how I'm feeling.

01:14:20.023 --> 01:14:22.392
- I know this seems hopeless.
- It is hopeless.

01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:25.295
No, it's not. I'm gonna figure this out.

01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:32.035
"Figure it out."

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:33.970
Trust me, precious.

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:35.905
If I haven't figured it out,

01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:39.108
you sure as shit aren't going to.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:41.154
What did you just say?

01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:44.847
I'm sorry, Kate. I didn't mean to...

01:14:44.947 --> 01:14:46.182
No, no. Wait a second.

01:14:46.282 --> 01:14:48.284
Back that up.

01:14:48.384 --> 01:14:52.088
Why do you think that you should be able

01:14:52.188 --> 01:14:54.429
to figure this out?

01:14:57.794 --> 01:14:59.762
I wasn't kidnapped.

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:03.633
When I found out they were
putting people in here,

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:05.868
I tried to blow the whistle on them.

01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:07.904
So they came after me.

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:11.941
I escaped into the one place
they wouldn't dare follow me...

01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:13.977
in here.

01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:17.149
Poetic justice, don't you think?

01:15:20.283 --> 01:15:22.685
Who are you?

01:15:22.785 --> 01:15:25.421
Max was right.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.624
Jerry was wrong.

01:15:27.724 --> 01:15:29.626
I exist.

01:15:29.726 --> 01:15:31.861
Oh, my God.

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:33.863
Sasha. Of course.

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:36.065
Sasha is the nickname for Alexandra.

01:15:36.165 --> 01:15:38.301
Alex Trusk.

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:41.382
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:48.811
Damn it.

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:52.148
This is the worst nightmare I've ever had.

01:15:52.248 --> 01:15:54.784
I just I wish I'd wake up.

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:58.520
You really think this is all a dream?

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:22.478
Definitely.

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:25.218
In the real world I'd never kiss you.

01:16:26.115 --> 01:16:28.254
Oh, really?

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:31.824
Yeah, you're not my type.

01:16:33.523 --> 01:16:35.469
You're not my type, either.

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.463
Becky Young.

01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:48.974
Yeah.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.035
Rebecca Young.

01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:54.637
Yeah.

01:17:54.737 --> 01:17:57.411
Who... are you?

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:04.180
Who am I? I'm Simon Grady.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.784
Your parents hired me to find you.

01:18:07.884 --> 01:18:09.552
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:18:09.652 --> 01:18:11.621
Thank God.

01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:12.989
Yeah.

01:18:13.089 --> 01:18:16.993
I'm happy to see you too, Becky.
I really am.

01:18:17.093 --> 01:18:20.129
I've been wandering these rooms for hours.

01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:22.843
Agh!

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:35.781
You gotta love these parallel universes.

01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:40.950
You built this thing?

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:43.152
I gave them the key to build it...

01:18:43.252 --> 01:18:45.087
better than they wanted.

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:47.256
I gave them a real hypercube.

01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:48.858
How do we get out?

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:52.607
Kate, this isn't a game.
There's no happy ending.

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:57.438
This place is out of control.
It's not stable.

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:01.037
Does this number mean nothing?

01:19:01.137 --> 01:19:03.539
6-0-6-5-9. It's got to mean something.

01:19:03.639 --> 01:19:05.541
It's everywhere.

01:19:05.641 --> 01:19:08.978
I'm sorry, Kate. It's over.

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:11.347
No, it is not over.

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:13.358
Not yet.

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:28.473
I refuse to die here.

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:35.814
What the hell?

01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:51.220
Oh, my God. We've got to move.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.189
Come on. We've got to get out of here.

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:55.462
- Leave me.
- No, you're coming with me.

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:58.828
Oh, my God.

01:19:58.928 --> 01:20:00.863
We got to get out of here.

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:03.633
Just go up as fast as you can.

01:20:03.733 --> 01:20:05.935
Faster, faster. Keep going.

01:20:06.035 --> 01:20:08.845
Okay. Good girl.

01:20:13.576 --> 01:20:15.112
What the hell?

01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:18.321
Oh, my God.

01:20:19.715 --> 01:20:21.991
Okay, we've got to get out of here.

01:20:28.758 --> 01:20:30.601
This is insane.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.709
It's Jerry's diagram.

01:20:44.807 --> 01:20:46.684
It's all the numbers.

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:58.897
They're all just suddenly in here.

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.829
It's Jerry's markings...

01:21:06.262 --> 01:21:09.573
that dead physicist's equations...

01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:13.436
and that damn colonel's corpse,

01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:17.313
just hanging there as if
we never even rescued him?

01:21:20.242 --> 01:21:24.054
Everything keeps appearing
over and over again.

01:21:26.148 --> 01:21:27.717
Sasha...

01:21:27.817 --> 01:21:31.787
please, you have to have
some idea what this means.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.056
All the realities are starting to collapse

01:21:34.156 --> 01:21:36.192
into one space.

01:21:36.292 --> 01:21:40.196
And what happens to us
when they... "it" collapses?

01:21:40.296 --> 01:21:42.932
The whole thing implodes.

01:21:43.032 --> 01:21:46.202
It's only a matter of time.

01:21:46.302 --> 01:21:50.444
I'm not gonna just stand here
while it happens.

01:21:54.677 --> 01:21:57.179
I'm not leaving him behind.

01:21:57.279 --> 01:21:59.782
- Oh, my God.
- Kate!

01:21:59.882 --> 01:22:02.952
- Let me go.
- Get the hell up here!

01:22:03.052 --> 01:22:04.987
Oh, my God.

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.756
Kate.

01:22:06.856 --> 01:22:08.858
We don't have much time.

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:31.647
No. I refuse to die here.

01:22:31.747 --> 01:22:33.716
I wish I had your spirit.

01:22:33.816 --> 01:22:35.718
Hello, gorgeous. Miss me?

01:22:35.818 --> 01:22:37.386
Huh? Come on in.

01:22:37.486 --> 01:22:39.432
The water's fine.

01:22:40.489 --> 01:22:41.524
Agh!

01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:47.963
Hello, Kate.

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:49.498
Let her go.

01:22:49.598 --> 01:22:51.635
Who are you?

01:22:53.202 --> 01:22:55.773
Yeah, it's me...

01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:59.575
good old Simon.

01:22:59.675 --> 01:23:02.978
Do you remember this? Do you?

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:05.684
I've waited a long time for pay back.

01:23:06.949 --> 01:23:09.018
That was just... seconds ago.

01:23:09.118 --> 01:23:10.820
Don't be so stupid, Kate.

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:14.094
Time works differently in this place.

01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:18.861
Hey, just... okay.

01:23:18.961 --> 01:23:21.664
Just let her go. She's just a kid.

01:23:21.764 --> 01:23:25.501
She'll be a dead little kid,
unless you come here to papa.

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:26.969
Okay.

01:23:27.069 --> 01:23:29.805
Just let her go...

01:23:29.905 --> 01:23:32.784
we can figure something out, okay?

01:23:34.643 --> 01:23:36.953
You take her place.

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:41.851
What do you want?

01:23:41.951 --> 01:23:44.620
I'm hungry.

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:47.723
- Simon?
- Huh?

01:23:47.823 --> 01:23:50.269
There's no point.

01:23:51.694 --> 01:23:54.029
We're all dead anyway.

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:56.298
Oh, oh.

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:58.071
Okay.

01:23:59.602 --> 01:24:00.672
No!

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:13.958
Oh, come on Kate.

01:24:15.684 --> 01:24:17.823
The fun's just beginning.

01:24:18.254 --> 01:24:20.063
Oh, my God.

01:24:27.329 --> 01:24:29.570
What the hell?

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.474
- Yah!
- Agh!

01:24:46.315 --> 01:24:49.194
I'm really gonna miss you.

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:06.208
Jesus...

01:25:11.774 --> 01:25:13.108
Of course,

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:15.911
6-0-6-5-9.

01:25:16.011 --> 01:25:18.013
It's an expiration date.

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:20.923
He figured out when it's gonna implode.

01:27:58.006 --> 01:27:59.917
Leave me.

01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:12.959
Hello, Kate. Welcome back.

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:17.793
So, you figured it out.

01:28:17.893 --> 01:28:20.129
Yes, sir.

01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:22.106
No time to spare.

01:28:24.366 --> 01:28:26.539
The device... any luck?

01:28:46.188 --> 01:28:50.136
We'll take that to Darcy and see
if anything recorded on it.

01:29:17.286 --> 01:29:18.587
Sir?

01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:20.322
Yes, sir.

01:29:20.422 --> 01:29:22.732
Phase two is terminated.

01:29:25.961 --> 01:29:27.736
I see.

01:29:29.865 --> 01:29:30.899
Yes, sir.

01:29:30.999 --> 01:29:32.637
Right away, sir.
