<p><strong>Marine Base G-13 &#39;The Bulwark&#39;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Formidable Marine fortress guarding Paradise/New World checkpoint. Commanded by rigid Vice Admiral hopeful (Commodore Rokkaku).</li>
<li><strong>Faction Control:</strong> Marines (World Government). High security.</li>
<li><strong>Gangs:</strong> N/A (Opponents are pirates).</li>
<li><strong>Leader Danger:</strong> 4/5 (Commodore &#39;Stone Fist&#39; Rokkaku - Rokushiki Master, Tekkai/Shigan specialist).</li>
<li><strong>Notable Landmarks:</strong> Main Gate carved with giant Marine symbol, Towering Seastone-Laced Walls, Execution Platform overlooking sea, Rokushiki Training Grounds, Commodore&#39;s Command Tower.</li>
<li><strong>Log Pose Behavior:</strong> Deliberately scrambled within 5 miles by Marine tech. Nearby islands set normally. Unauthorized Eternal Poses confiscated.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Hazards:</strong> Constant Marine patrols (sea/land/air via Moonwalk), watchtower snipers, Seastone weaponry/cells, risk of triggering Buster Call protocols, Rokushiki users everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Key NPCs:</strong><ul>
<li>Commodore &#39;Stone Fist&#39; Rokkaku: Base Commander, stern believer in Absolute Justice.</li>
<li>Captain Blade: Zealous subordinate, eager to capture pirates for promotion.</li>
<li>Mess Hall Chief &#39;Salty&#39; Rorick: Grumbles constantly but hears all base gossip.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Local Legends/Rumors:</strong> The fortress is built on the ruins of Gol D. Roger&#39;s first landing spot in the Grand Line (false WG propaganda); Rokkaku possesses Armament Haki strong enough to dent Seastone (exaggerated); a secret sea tunnel allows covert supply entry.</li>
<li><strong>Minecraft Build Style:</strong> Stone bricks, polished andesite/diorite, iron bars, blue/white wool banners, sea lanterns, obsidian reinforcements, cyan terracotta/prismarine variants (representing Seastone).</li>
<li><strong>Unique Local Resource:</strong> Confiscated Pirate Goods (Requires infiltration), Standard Marine-Issue Cutlass/Rifle.</li>
<li><strong>Atmosphere/Soundscape:</strong> Rhythmic marching boots, sharp shouted commands, distant cannon drills, constant ringing of Den Den Mushi, clanging of cell doors, disciplined silence in halls.</li>
<li><strong>Marine Bounty Poster Presence:</strong> Prominently displayed in multiple locations (gatehouse, mess hall, briefing rooms), updated weekly. Focus on high-value targets (&gt;100M Beri) and those known to operate nearby.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Quest Hooks:</strong> Infiltrate the base to free Player 2&#39;s wrongly imprisoned associate; Create a large-scale diversion to allow a friendly ship to pass the blockade undetected.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Technology Level:</strong> Advanced Marine warships, cannons, standard firearms, extensive Seastone tech (handcuffs, cell bars, nets, possibly experimental ammo), high-power/surveillance Den Den Mushi, basic Log Pose jamming, Rokushiki mastery.</li>
<li><strong>Dominant Race:</strong> Primarily Human Marines, occasional Giant Squad members or other allied WG races integrated.</li>
<li><strong>Sea King Activity:</strong> Marines actively hunt/deter large Sea Kings within patrol radius using cannons and Seastone weaponry.</li>
<li><strong>News Coo Reliability:</strong> Secure WG/Marine intelligence arrives daily via coded Den Den Mushi. Public News Coo arrivals are screened for sensitive information.</li>
<li><strong>Black Market Specialty:</strong> None. Corruption is severely punished under Rokkaku&#39;s command.</li>
<li><strong>Alliances/Rivalries:</strong> Integral part of WG/Marine structure; Hostile to all pirates attempting passage; Potential rivalry with other G-bases for funding/prestige.</li>
<li><strong>Recurring Events:</strong> Weekly full-base inspection by Rokkaku; Public execution of notable captured pirates; Arrival/Departure ceremonies for ranking officers.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility Challenges:</strong> Heavily guarded sea/land approaches, requires official clearance papers (hard to forge), stealth, or overwhelming force; Log Pose jamming; Airspace patrolled by Moonwalk users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More information and quests</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Formidable Marine fortress guarding checkpoint. Commanded by Commodore Rokkaku. Log Pose Jammed nearby.</li>
<li><strong>Faction Control:</strong> Marines (World Government). High security.</li>
<li><strong>Inter-factional Conflicts:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Rokushiki Specialists vs. Standard Marines:</strong> Subtle rivalry/arrogance from CP agents or Rokushiki users towards rank-and-file soldiers, sometimes leading to unfair treatment or dangerous assignments.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligence Branch vs. Combat Branch:</strong> Disagreements over tactics, resource allocation, and the handling of prisoners/intelligence between those focused on information gathering and those on direct combat.</li>
<li><strong>Commodore Rokkaku vs. Ambitious Captains:</strong> Subordinates (like Captain Blade) might subtly try to undermine Rokkaku or take credit for captures to advance their own careers within the rigid Marine hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>NPCs:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Good (From Pirate POV):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Prisoner #42:</strong> Wrongfully imprisoned individual (related to player backstory?). Knows layout of the brig and guard routines. Desperate for escape, offers vital intel.</li>
<li><strong>Mess Hall Chief &#39;Salty&#39; Rorick:</strong> Grumbles about officers but secretly hates the World Government&#39;s hypocrisy. Might slip players extra rations or overlook suspicious activity for small bribes (Sugar, Cocoa Beans).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Neutral:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Quartermaster:</strong> Manages base supplies. Bureaucratic and follows rules, but might trade non-lethal supplies (Food, Torches, basic Blocks) for rare off-island goods or information about pirate supply routes (if presented cleverly).</li>
<li><strong>Visiting WG Official:</strong> Inspecting the base. Arrogant and easily distracted by perceived threats or offers of &#39;local delicacies&#39; (rare fish/food). Could be a useful diversion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bad:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Commodore &#39;Stone Fist&#39; Rokkaku:</strong> Base Commander. Embodiment of Absolute Justice, powerful Rokushiki user. Views players as scum to be captured or executed. Extremely dangerous.</li>
<li><strong>Captain Blade:</strong> Zealous and ambitious Marine Captain. Eager to capture pirates, sees players as stepping stones for promotion. Ruthless in pursuit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Economic Details (Minecraft Trading):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Exports (Players Sell - Risky!):</strong> False Information (to mislead patrols), Contraband (to corrupt guards - very rare under Rokkaku), Services (sabotage - extremely risky).</li>
<li><strong>Imports (Players Buy/Steal):</strong> Confiscated Goods (Iron/Gold Nuggets, Tools, Weapons - from evidence lockup), Standard Marine Rations (Bread, Cooked Meat), Basic Supplies (Torches, Coal, Iron Bars from cells), <em>Possibly</em> Seastone Handcuffs (rare item - requires defeating high-rank officers).</li>
<li><strong>Local Currency:</strong> Strict adherence to Beri (Emeralds) unlikely for trade with pirates. Focus on stealing needed supplies or information. Bribes might work on extremely low-level, disgruntled personnel but are risky.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Chaotic Neutral Quest Suggestions:</strong><ol>
<li><strong>The Great Escape:</strong> Player 2&#39;s wrongly convicted associate (Prisoner #42) is here. Infiltrate the brig, cause a major diversion (e.g., releasing other prisoners, triggering alarms in a different section, sabotaging a cannon), and escape with the associate during the chaos.</li>
<li><strong>Evidence Tampering:</strong> Retrieve incriminating evidence against a rival pirate crew stored in the base&#39;s evidence lockup. Getting caught means war, but success means leverage over your rivals. Requires stealth and timing.</li>
<li><strong>Sabotage &amp; Run:</strong> A large Marine fleet is preparing to depart from G-13 to raid a location important to the players (maybe Mock Town or an allied island). Infiltrate the docks and sabotage key ships (destroying masts/rudders, setting fires) to delay or weaken the fleet, then escape before Rokkaku brings the full force down.</li>
