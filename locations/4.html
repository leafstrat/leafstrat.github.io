<p><strong>Mock Town - East Blue Branch</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Lawless pirate town, scrappy cousin to Jaya&#39;s Mock Town. Built from salvage. Haven for rookies, bounty hunters, underworld deals.</li>
<li><strong>Faction Control:</strong> Pirate Anarchy. Informal &#39;Council of Captains&#39; (often resolves via brawls). Dominated by strongest crew in port.</li>
<li><strong>Gangs:</strong> Sea Dog Pirates (Current top dogs, basic brawlers), Scalpel Crew (Info/theft specialists), Harpy&#39;s Hoarders (Cunning female crew), numerous small crews/bounty hunters.</li>
<li><strong>Leader Danger:</strong> Varies (Currently 3/5 - Captain &#39;Iron Jaw&#39; Grogg, Sea Dogs). Danger level shifts constantly.</li>
<li><strong>Notable Landmarks:</strong> &#39;The Rotten Keel&#39; Tavern (Central hub, always noisy), Makeshift Fighting Arena (blood-stained sand), Bounty Broker&#39;s Shack (covered in posters), Towering Pile of Ship Salvage, &#39;Dreamer&#39;s Pier&#39; (where rookies boast/get robbed).</li>
<li><strong>Log Pose Behavior:</strong> Standard (Sets in 1 day). However, Log Poses are frequently stolen or broken in fights.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Hazards:</strong> Constant risk of bar fights/duels, pickpockets, collapsing makeshift structures, poor sanitation/disease, high chance of betrayal.</li>
<li><strong>Key NPCs:</strong><ul>
<li>&#39;One-Eye&#39; Meg: Owner/bartender of Rotten Keel, seen it all, tough as nails.</li>
<li>Shanksy the Info Broker: Sells rumors (50% true, 50% fabricated), always looking over his shoulder.</li>
<li>Grok the Shipwright: Does crude, cheap repairs, usually drunk, might know ship secrets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Local Legends/Rumors:</strong> A fragment of Captain John&#39;s treasure map was once gambled away here; Bellamy stopped here before Jaya and mocked everyone; a Devil Fruit was found, eaten, and the user immediately drowned falling off the pier drunk.</li>
<li><strong>Minecraft Build Style:</strong> Ramshackle mix of all wood types (oak, spruce, dark oak), mismatched planks, patched holes with wool/dirt, salvaged ship decorations (figureheads, wheels), barrels, mud/coarse dirt paths. Chaotic and poorly maintained.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Local Resource:</strong> Dubious Pirate Grog (Item: Provides temporary strength buff but also nausea debuff).</li>
<li><strong>Atmosphere/Soundscape:</strong> Loud drunken shouting/singing, constant sounds of brawling (breaking wood/glass), seagulls fighting over refuse, boastful laughter, creaking planks, occasional flintlock shot.</li>
<li><strong>Marine Bounty Poster Presence:</strong> Plastered everywhere - on walls, tables, used as dartboards. Focus on East Blue/early Grand Line bounties (&lt;50M Beri). Bounty hunters use them as shopping lists.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Quest Hooks:</strong> Win a brawl in the arena to gain respect or information; Track down and retrieve a specific item stolen by a rival pirate.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Technology Level:</strong> Very basic flintlocks, cannons, crude ship repair techniques. Anything advanced is stolen, broken, or misunderstood.</li>
<li><strong>Dominant Race:</strong> Primarily Human, but attracts desperate individuals of any race looking to become pirates.</li>
<li><strong>Sea King Activity:</strong> Average presence. Sometimes hunted poorly by pirates for food or bragging rights.</li>
<li><strong>News Coo Reliability:</strong> Arrives daily, eagerly bought and fought over for bounty updates and Grand Line news.</li>
<li><strong>Black Market Specialty:</strong> Stolen Goods (anything not nailed down), Low-level Bounty Brokerage, Unreliable Maps/Information, Hiring of Thugs/Crewmates.</li>
<li><strong>Alliances/Rivalries:</strong> Constant flux. Crews ally temporarily for mutual benefit, then betray each other. General hostility towards Marines (though corrupt suppliers might visit). Fierce competition.</li>
<li><strong>Recurring Events:</strong> Spontaneous town-wide brawls, Arrival of arrogant rookie crews declaring themselves &#39;King&#39;, &#39;Plunder Market Day&#39; (selling recently stolen goods), Bounty Hunter face-offs.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility Challenges:</strong> Open port but extremely dangerous for anyone perceived as weak or wealthy. Reputation (or lack thereof) matters. Betrayal is common.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More information and quests</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Lawless pirate town, salvage construction. Hub for rookies, bounty hunters, deals. Log Pose Standard.</li>
<li><strong>Faction Control:</strong> Pirate Anarchy. Informal &#39;Council of Captains&#39;. Dominated by strongest crew.</li>
<li><strong>Inter-factional Conflicts:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Dominant Crew vs. Challengers:</strong> The current top crew (e.g., Sea Dogs) constantly defends its status against ambitious rivals through brawls, duels, and sabotage. Alliances shift constantly.</li>
<li><strong>Pirates vs. Bounty Hunters:</strong> An uneasy coexistence. Bounty hunters are tolerated as long as they don&#39;t cause <em>too</em> much trouble or target the currently powerful crews. Fights often break out over specific bounties.</li>
<li><strong>Merchants/Brokers vs. Everyone:</strong> Tavern keepers, info brokers, and crude shipwrights try to profit from the chaos while avoiding getting robbed or caught in crossfire. They often play pirates against each other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>NPCs:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Good (From Pirate POV):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>&#39;One-Eye&#39; Meg:</strong> Tough tavern keeper (Rotten Keel). Doesn&#39;t like bullies, might offer shelter or a tip-off if players treat her place with <em>some</em> respect (and pay their tab - Emeralds/Iron Ingots). Hates the dominant crew if they get too pushy.</li>
<li><strong>&#39;Lucky&#39; Finn:</strong> Down-on-his-luck gambler. Owes everyone money but overhears everything. Might trade valuable rumors or tip-offs about incoming bounties/cargo for help paying off a debt or a stake (Emeralds).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Neutral:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Shanksy the Info Broker:</strong> Sells unreliable info for Emeralds or interesting items (Compasses, Clocks). Will sell info <em>about</em> the players just as easily as <em>to</em> them. Switches allegiance based on profit.</li>
<li><strong>Grok the Shipwright:</strong> Drunken but skilled salvage-shipwright. Can do crude repairs or modifications (using player-provided Iron/Wood) for excessive amounts of alcohol (Potions?) or Emeralds. Doesn&#39;t care who you are as long as you pay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bad:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Captain &#39;Iron Jaw&#39; Grogg:</strong> Leader of the currently dominant Sea Dog Pirates. Bullying, arrogant, sees players as potential recruits to boss around or easy targets to rob. Demands respect (or tribute).</li>
<li><strong>&#39;Grim&#39; Reaver:</strong> Notorious bounty hunter currently in town, known for bringing targets back dead or alive. Might decide the players&#39; starting bounty is worth collecting. Cold and efficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Economic Details (Minecraft Trading):</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Exports (Players Sell):</strong> Stolen Goods (Anything valuable - Gold/Iron Ingots, Wool, Food), Information, Services (Muscle for hire), Plunder from other ships.</li>
<li><strong>Imports (Players Buy):</strong> Crude Weapons/Armor (Iron), Cannonballs (Iron Nuggets/Blocks?), Rum (Potions?), Food Supplies, Unreliable Maps (Paper), Log Pose Setting (Emeralds - risky), Crude Ship Repairs (Wood/Iron Blocks).</li>
<li><strong>Local Currency:</strong> Emeralds (standard), Barter (stolen goods), Favors/Debts (often violent).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Chaotic Neutral Quest Suggestions:</strong><ol>
<li><strong>Hostile Takeover:</strong> Captain Grogg is throwing his weight around too much. Undermine his authority by raiding his crew&#39;s supply cache, defeating his toughest lieutenants in the arena, or framing him for attacking a bounty hunter (causing chaos). Take over as the dominant crew, or just enjoy the power vacuum.</li>
<li><strong>Bounty Bait:</strong> &#39;Grim&#39; Reaver is hunting a pirate with a valuable Devil Fruit rumor attached. Steal the bounty puck/poster, feed Reaver false information leading him on a wild goose chase, then track down the actual target yourself to claim the potential Devil Fruit info (or just their loot).</li>
<li><strong>Salvage Scramble:</strong> A rich merchant ship recently wrecked nearby. Grogg&#39;s crew, another rival crew, and the players all race to salvage the valuable cargo (Diamonds, Gold Blocks, rare silks/wool). Fight off rivals and sea hazards to claim the biggest share.</li>
